The key theme is what I call \u201csynesthetic computation\u201d: when subjective context, UI state, agent memory, and system permissions get blended together in ways that feel natural to users but collapse important security boundaries. When an agent is allowed to act across chat, browser, and local tooling, those boundaries become part of the attack surface.<p>In this case, a crafted link can cause a client to connect to an attacker-controlled gateway, leak a token, and then allow that attacker to reconfigure the agent\u2019s execution environment and run arbitrary commands on the host. The interesting part isn\u2019t just the bug\u2014it\u2019s how quickly convenience-driven design patterns in local AI agents can produce \u201cgod-mode\u201d blast radius when trust is mis-scoped.<p>The write-up focuses on:\n\u2013 how local agents collapse UI + infra trust layers\n\u2013 why \u201cruns locally\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically mean \u201csafe\u201d\n\u2013 how agent autonomy changes the RCE threat model\n\u2013 what defensive patterns might look like for agent platforms<p>Curious how others are thinking about the security model for local autonomous agents and whether we need new mental models beyond traditional sandboxing and token scoping.","title":"Show HN: Synesthetic Computation","updated_at":"2026-02-16T11:22:59Z","url":"https://medium.com/@FoxEars42/show-hackernews-synesthetic-computation-a-k-a-full-rce-over-openclaw-c756e0c35d69"},{"_highlightResult":{"author":{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"mupengism"},"story_text":{"fullyHighlighted":false,"matchLevel":"full","matchedWords":["ai","agent","platform"],"value":"After burning $500/month on various SaaS tools (CRM, social media scheduler, customer support), I built a custom <em>AI</em> <em>agent</em> using OpenClaw (<a href=\"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw</a>) that handles all of it.<p>The <em>agent</em> runs 24/7 on my Mac Mini.
