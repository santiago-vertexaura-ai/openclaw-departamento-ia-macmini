The simplest primitive I\u2019ve found is Git worktrees. It is not as isolated nor heavy as containers&#x2F;vms, but it is the next best thing for working locally. Each agent gets its own working directory and their own snapshot of the repo. Git worktree requires CLI kung-fu, but agentastic simplifies it through some nice GUI and keyboard shortcuts for easy creation&#x2F;switching&#x2F;etc.<p>* An excellent terminal: I couldn\u2019t get comfortable with xterm.js (Code&#x2F;Cursor&#x2F;Conductor&#x2F;etc), and i loved Ghostty, it is fast, pretty, and feels right. So naturally the whole experience is built around Ghostty (There is also SwiftTerm as an alternative option).<p>Agentastic.dev is a native mac IDE, built around the workflow of \u201cone task = one worktree = one terminal session\u201d as the default. You spin up multiple worktrees (branches) and run different agents in parallel, each with its own clean working directory and terminal session and codeedit, then review and merge when you\u2019re ready.<p>We\u2019ve been dogfooding it to build <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;agentastic.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;agentastic.dev</a> itself and agentastic.com (coming soon), and it\u2019s noticeably improved our productivity.\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pasteboard.co&#x2F;xg1YOsk5MIn9.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pasteboard.co&#x2F;xg1YOsk5MIn9.png</a><p>It\u2019s early and still rough in places.

Built on Claude Code, it provides instant answers while maintaining complete privacy through self-hosting.<p>*Core capabilities:*\n- Analyzes code architecture and explains complex functions\n- Detects bugs and automatically creates GitHub issues\n- Answers stakeholder questions without developer interruption\n- Maintains conversation context via Discord threads\n- Read-only by design (analysis only, no code modifications)<p>## Technical Architecture<p>*Stack:*\n- Node.js&#x2F;Bun runtime with Discord.js\n- Claude Code CLI for AI-powered analysis\n- GitHub CLI for automatic issue creation\n- Docker container with automated setup<p>*Key technical features:*\n- Streaming responses with real-time JSON parsing\n- Thread-based session management for context retention\n- Fire-and-forget concurrency model (each message spawns independent Claude process)\n- Comprehensive system prompt optimized for Discord constraints\n- Server whitelisting and permission controls<p>*One-line deployment:*\n```bash\ndocker run -d --name bobby \\\n  -e DISCORD_TOKEN=token \\\n  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=key \\\n  -e GITHUB_REPO=owner&#x2F;repo \\\n  stewart86&#x2F;bobby:latest\n```<p>## Privacy-First Design<p>Unlike SaaS alternatives:\n- Your code never leaves your infrastructure\n- You create and control your own Discord bot\n- Direct API relationship with Anthropic (no middleman)\n- Isolated Docker environment\n- Complete audit trail<p>## Real-World Impact<p>After months of dogfooding with my team:\n- 70% reduction in developer interruptions for basic questions\n- Stakeholders get instant answers instead of waiting for meetings\n- Product tickets come with proper technical context\n- Bug detection during normal conversations<p>*Example workflow:*\n1.
