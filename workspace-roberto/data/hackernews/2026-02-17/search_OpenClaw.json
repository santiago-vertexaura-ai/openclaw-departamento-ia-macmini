So I built it in Go.<p>*How it's different from <em>OpenClaw</em>:*<p>- *Single binary, no runtime needed.* Download, set your API key, run. No Node.js, no pnpm, no build step. One ~100 MB binary.\n- *Built in Go.* Fast startup, low memory footprint, compiles to a native executable. No garbage collector pauses from a JS runtime sitting in the background.\n- *macOS-native integrations.* Deep AppleScript-based control of Apple Notes, Reminders, Calendar, Terminal.app, and WeChat desktop. These aren't browser hacks \u2014 they use the native accessibility and scripting APIs.\n- *WeChat support.* This was a big one for me. WeChat desktop on macOS is a native Cocoa/Qt app with a readable accessibility tree. CoolWulf can read messages, send messages, search contacts, and navigate chats \u2014 all via AX APIs and CGEvent. I haven't seen another AI agent do this.\n- *Simpler setup.* Web-based first-time wizard.

No terminal wizards, no YAML files.<p>*What it does:*<p>- 20+ LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, Ollama, local models via vLLM/LM Studio)\n- Messaging: WhatsApp, Teams, Telegram, Slack, WeChat\n- Email: Gmail and Yahoo Mail with full OAuth\n- Calendar: Google Calendar + Apple Calendar\n- Browser automation: Chrome CDP + Playwright via MCP\n- Task management: org-mode style with scheduled tasks, cron jobs, automatic execution\n- Persistent memory: SQLite + vector embeddings for semantic search across conversations\n- Background heartbeat: runs 24/7, monitors your systems, executes due tasks, sends alerts\n- Web dashboard for chat, tasks, scheduled jobs, and settings<p>*Architecture choices:*<p>Go was the right call. The binary compiles in seconds, cross-compiles trivially, and the concurrency model (goroutines for heartbeat, browser sessions, connector polling) maps perfectly to an always-on agent.
