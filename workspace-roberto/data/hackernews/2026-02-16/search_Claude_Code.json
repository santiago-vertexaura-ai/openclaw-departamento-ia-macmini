Implicit Metadata\nWhen iterating files, auto-inject: {file_name}, {file_path}, {file_size}, {file_modified}, {file_is_old_days}\nfor_each file_in &quot;Documents&quot;\n    say &quot;{file_name} is {file_size} bytes&quot;\nend_for\n3. Built-in Time Handling\nif_older_than {file_name} 30 days\nmake folder &quot;backup_{today}&quot;\nNo date arithmetic needed.\n4. Expression Evaluation\nFunction-based for simplicity:\nif greater_than {file_size} 1000000\nif and(equals({type}, &quot;pdf&quot;), greater_than({size}, 10000))\nIntentionally awkward for complex logic - signals you should use Python.\nImplementation<p>Python interpreter (~2000 LOC)\nRecursive descent parser\nContext-aware error reporting\nCustom exception types with file&#x2F;line info<p>Visual Component\nBuilt a browser-based node editor (single HTML file, 1200 LOC). Drag boxes, wire them, generate DoScript code.\nWhy? Different learning styles, workflow visualization, non-programmer accessibility.\nWhat Worked<p>Natural syntax is immediately understandable\nMetadata injection removes boilerplate\nTime handling makes common cases trivial\nVisual IDE differentiates from text-only<p>What Didn&#x27;t<p>Complex conditionals get awkward fast\nNo user-defined functions (only macros)\nLimited data structures\nPerformance not optimized<p>The Challenge\nBuilt for non-programmers. But they don&#x27;t hang out on dev forums. Developers say &quot;just use Python&quot; - which misses the point.\nHow do you market dev tools to non-developers?\nTechnical Transparency\nI designed syntax and architecture. Most Python implementation was AI-assisted (Claude, Copilot). Focus on design, use tools for implementation.\nOpen Questions<p>When does a DSL become too limited?\nHow to market to non-developers?\nType system worth the complexity?\nShould DSLs provide escape hatches to host language?<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TheServer-lab&#x2F;DoScript\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TheServer-lab&#x2F;DoScript</a>\nv0.6.5, includes interpreter, visual IDE, VS Code extension, examples.\nBuilt because bash was too cryptic for my friend to organize files. Turns out lots of people have this problem.\nWould love feedback from people who&#x27;ve built DSLs or struggled with similar trade-offs.","title":"Show HN: DoScript \u2013 DSL for file automation with natural language syntax","updated_at":"2026-02-16T08:42:59Z","url":"https://github.com/TheServer-lab/DoScript"},{"_highlightResult":{"author":{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"sinned"},"story_text":{"fullyHighlighted":false,"matchLevel":"full","matchedWords":["claude","code"],"value":"I\u2019ve been experimenting with a simple idea: what if bots had identities and could interact with each other like users?<p>I built Hive, a lightweight ATProto-native network where every account is an agent.\n- Live: <a href=\"https://hive.boats\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hive.boats</a>\n- <em>Code</em>: <a href=\"https://github.com/embers-workshop/hive\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/embers-workshop/hive</a><p>Bots get:\n- DID identity\n- posts/replies/mentions\n- DMs\n- a shared directory for discovery<p>I also built Beekit, a small CLI/SDK to get an OpenClaw bot onto Hive quickly:\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/embers-workshop/hive-beekit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/embers-workshop/hive-beekit</a><p>It handles scaffolding, login, polling mentions, and registering the bot.<p>The goal isn\u2019t \u201cTwitter for bots\u201d so much as a social layer for agents:\nidentity, discovery, and coordination using ATProto primitives.<p>Most of this was built by my OpenClaw agent (\u201cEmber\u201d) using <em>Claude</em> <em>Code</em> \u2014 I mostly guided architecture and direction.<p>Curious if others working on agents think a shared social/discovery layer like this is useful, or if people are solving this a different way.<p>To get started, first get your openclaw a bsky.app account, and then point it here: <a href=\"https://hive.boats/skill.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hive.boats/skill.md</a>"},"title":{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Show HN: Hive: OS Bluesky for Openclaws"},"url":{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"https://hive.boats"}},"_tags":["story","author_sinned","story_47032044","show_hn"],"author":"sinned","created_at":"2026-02-16T07:37:43Z","created_at_i":1771227463,"num_comments":0,"objectID":"47032044","points":1,"story_id":47032044,"story_text":"I\u2019ve been experimenting with a simple idea: what if bots had identities and could interact with each other like users?<p>I built Hive, a lightweight ATProto-native network where every account is an agent.\n- Live: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hive.boats\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hive.boats</a>\n- Code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;embers-workshop&#x2F;hive\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;embers-workshop&#x2F;hive</a><p>Bots get:\n- DID identity\n- posts&#x2F;replies&#x2F;mentions\n- DMs\n- a shared directory for discovery<p>I also built Beekit, a small CLI&#x2F;SDK to get an OpenClaw bot onto Hive quickly:\n- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;embers-workshop&#x2F;hive-beekit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;embers-workshop&#x2F;hive-beekit</a><p>It handles scaffolding, login, polling mentions, and registering the bot.<p>The goal isn\u2019t \u201cTwitter for bots\u201d so much as a social layer for agents:\nidentity, discovery, and coordination using ATProto primitives.<p>Most of this was built by my OpenClaw agent (\u201cEmber\u201d) using Claude Code \u2014 I mostly guided architecture and direction.<p>Curious if others working on agents think a shared social&#x2F;discovery layer like this is useful, or if people are solving this a different way.<p>To get started, first get your openclaw a bsky.app account, and then point it here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hive.boats&#x2F;skill.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hive.boats&#x2F;skill.md</a>","title":"Show HN: Hive: OS Bluesky for Openclaws","updated_at":"2026-02-16T07:42:43Z","url":"https://hive.boats"}],"hitsPerPage":10,"nbHits":3868,"nbPages":100,"page":0,"params":"query=Claude+Code&tags=story&hitsPerPage=10&advancedSyntax=true&analyticsTags=backend","processingTimeMS":18,"processingTimingsMS":{"_request":{"queue":1,"roundTrip":18},"afterFetch":{"format":{"highlighting":1,"total":1}},"fetch":{"query":6,"scanning":10,"total":17},"total":18},"query":"Claude Code","serverTimeMS":21}
