Claude Code. Never used openclaw this was and still is more advanced in most ways, especially memory and knowledge management. 

Using Claude code headless is exactly as intended, no tos issues. 

Do you know WHY it’s failing on your web fetches? There are a few diff solutions depending on the actual issue.

@EdwardJacksonD @jessegenet @openclaw I asked it to make a blender file with a building and it did it first try. It was basic but it was something

Fascinating demos! IBA's adaptability from fintech security to superintelligence containment is impressive—real-time validation and kill switches could enhance NIST's interoperability goals. The cross-platform enforcement in those examples shows strong potential. How do you see it scaling for multi-agent systems?

@steipete @openclaw “failed 43 times” is a funny way to say “built enough surface area for luck to finally stick.”

OpenAI Didn't Buy a Product. They Bought a Distribution Channel.

OpenAI didn't just acqui-hire OpenClaw's creator—they captured a token furnace that was sending millions in API revenue to Anthropic. Agent defaults are the new search engine deals.

My Hawk Openclaw AI agent just started with live trades on Polymarket. 

Very early days but a private island could be mine by year end. https://t.co/RaJEfGcyOD
