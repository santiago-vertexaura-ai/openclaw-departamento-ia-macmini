Testing at scale usually means drowning in noise—wasting hours sifting through visual clutter or accessibility alerts that don't actually impact your users.

We’ve embedded 3 AI Agents directly inside the BrowserStack Website Scanner to change that. 

It doesn't just flag issues; it understands them to make testing smarter. Meet the agents:

1️⃣ Visual Review Agent: Intelligent noise reduction that goes beyond simple pixel differences. It filters out inconsistencies and highlights only the visual changes that actually matter.

2️⃣ Accessibility Issue Detection Agent: Tests accessibility with the nuance of a human expert to accurately identify complex context—like distinguishing between decorative and functional images.

3️⃣ Accessibility Remediation Agent: Get expert-level actionable remediation guidance including instantly available code-ready fixes for WCAG violations. 

Review smarter. Fix faster. Ship with confidence.

@cyfrin (Cyfrin Audits):
What this means for protocol security:

→ Vulnerabilities that "probably won't be found" will be found 
→ Obscurity is no longer a defense — AI agents don't get bored or overlook edge cases 
→ The window between deployment and exploitation is shrinking

@cyfrin (Cyfrin Audits):
The economics are the real concern.

Exploit revenue from AI agents roughly doubled every 1.3 months over the past year. As API costs fall, deploying hundreds of agents to probe every contract on-chain becomes viable.

Attackers won't just target high-TVL protocols. They'll scan everything.

@cyfrin (Cyfrin Audits):
🤖 AI agents just autonomously exploited 207 out of 405 real smart contracts in simulation — extracting $550M in mock funds.

They also found 2 novel zero-day vulnerabilities in live contracts that no human had identified.

This changes the threat model for every protocol.

@KeystoneWallet (Keystone Hardware Wallet):
If you're building AI agents that touch wallets, APIs, or sensitive data, you need a hardware trust layer.

Pre-order ForgeBox and be among the first devs to ship with real security built in:

@PrivacyPalAI's first users and enterprises are humans. 

Not for long.

AI agents are building a machine economy where privacy violations happen at millions of transactions per second.

Privacy isn't about hiding anymore, it's about maintaining human agency when machines represent us. The infrastructure we build today determines which future we get.

Looking forward for tomorrow!

Great to see impactful cases like this, adopted by global enterprises, led by great entrepreneurs @jasonmelo, @shayraantia and team, leveraging the infrastructure of the Machine Economy.

@KeystoneWallet (Keystone Hardware Wallet):
🦞 AI agents can act autonomously, but your private keys sit exposed in software.

One compromised dependency.
One leaked file.
Everything gone.

Most devs know this risk. Almost none have a practical fix.

@AlexCalderAI (Alex Calder):
Built 3 new guides overnight. First one: how to build your first AI agent in 30 minutes.

The hard part isn't building agents. It's finding problems worth automating.

Start with something that saves you 30 min/week. Then iterate.

@thomasheimann (Thomas Heimann):
Most real estate agents chase volume. The real leverage is intelligence: speed, certainty, and systems. Focus on what humans can’t scale—AI can handle the rest.
