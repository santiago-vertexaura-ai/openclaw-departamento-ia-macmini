@CryptoBababooey Yeah start by talking to your agent and explain the entire structure

@jwsaml I’ll try to work and build it out but this will benefit your OpenClaw agent a lot 👀

@VadimStrizheus (Vadim):
The office. Basically I told Jarvis I wanted a 2D pixel HQ/office for my employees where I can see them walking around and whenever they're working they go walk to their desks. He just built that out for me using my senior developer so I think just talk with your OpaClaw agent and you can definitely figure it out.

@VadimStrizheus (Vadim):
Day 7 of OpenClaw 🦞 

My AI company now has 9 employees that work 24/7!! 

I broke down all of my token optimizations, costs, and what every single agent does. 👀 

The amount of value this has brought into my life so far has been incredible. 

I truly can’t wait to see where I’ll be in a month from now. 

I’m 18

No prior coding experience 

This proves that anybody can do it.

@VadimStrizheus (Vadim):
Stop using OpenClaw like a search engine.

Build employees instead:

1. Give it a role (Developer, Researcher, Writer)
2. Give it a personality (Soul File)
3. Give it memory (daily logs)
4. Give it tools (API keys, skills)

One AI agent = assistant
Multiple AI agents = company

I manage 7 AI employees. 

I'm 18 with no prior coding experience or knowledge. 

This is your sign to start today. 🫡

@VadimStrizheus (Vadim):
THIS IS THE FUTURE!! 

I have Claude Code debugging and troubleshooting my clipping agent on my MacBook on the right, while my entire Vugola AI team is working 24/7 on my Mac Mini on the left. 

100% of my code has been coded by AI, and all I have to do is just give prompts to Claude Code, and it builds a $215M software. 

You don't need to know how to code in 2026, all you need is a MacBook and OpenClaw. 

I'm calling that vibe-coding will become the #1 skillset in the next decade.

We are only a month into 2026, I'm genuinely SHOCKED!!

@VadimStrizheus (Vadim):
@ulriksparboe Jarvis oversees everything and each agent has their own MCP server. He just reports to me what gets done, what they're talking about, discussing, building, researching, etc

@VadimStrizheus (Vadim):
@ILokasta So far I have not been hitting any limits and also make sure that your open call agent isn't doing all the work because that's how you burn through credits the most. You want to set up agents like I did, so they delegate the tasks and take off the workload

@VadimStrizheus (Vadim):
The way I have it structured is that I'm the CEO and he's my CSO. Whatever I say goes because I'm the head of the company and he's just my Chief Strategist Officer. That's how our working relationship is. Just make sure you specify with your agent how your expectation standards and working relationship should be.

@paul_popov @VugolaAI Would be too expensive 

Atlas uses GLM 4.7, firecrawl, brave api, and has browser access to search, screenshot, etc. 

The ultimate research agent

@VadimStrizheus (Vadim):
I like to think of this way: I have one open claw agent, so the brain is Opus, and then since I don't want Opus to be doing everything, I have muscles.

- For coding I use Codex.
- For web search I use Gemini.
- For social search I use Grok.

Still it calls Opus, so Opus oversees everything. Individually for coding and searching it's going to use Opus as the brain to reason, but in itself I'm calling API keys for Codex, Gemini, and Grok.

The clipping agent for v1 is DONE!! 🎉

I vibe-coded a $215M software in 2 months with ZERO coding experience. 

I'm testing different podcasts and interviews right now, and here is a glimpse of what the clips look like. 

What do you think? 👇 https://t.co/n6NeDEHdyk
