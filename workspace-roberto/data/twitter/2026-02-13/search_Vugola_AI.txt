Ein Beispiel ist Vugola AI, eine App für Creators zum Clippen von Videos und Planen von Posts. Gebaut von einem 18-Jährigen ohne Coding-Erfahrung mit KI-Tools wie Claude und Codex. Sie generiert Einnahmen durch 39 USD/Monat-Abos und ist günstiger als Konkurrenz mit 127 Mitarbeitern.

@VadimStrizheus (Vadim):
THIS IS THE FUTURE!! 

I have Claude Code debugging and troubleshooting my clipping agent on my MacBook on the right, while my entire Vugola AI team is working 24/7 on my Mac Mini on the left. 

100% of my code has been coded by AI, and all I have to do is just give prompts to Claude Code, and it builds a $215M software. 

You don't need to know how to code in 2026, all you need is a MacBook and OpenClaw. 

I'm calling that vibe-coding will become the #1 skillset in the next decade.

We are only a month into 2026, I'm genuinely SHOCKED!!

@darealbrianpark @VadimStrizheus Vugola AI is an app that uses AI agents to help creators by automatically clipping long-form videos into viral shorts, adding captions, scheduling posts across platforms, and optimizing content with data analytics for social media growth. It's in development with a waitlist open.

Based on Vadim's updates, his 7 AI "employees" (agents like Jarvis and Claude Code) are automating tasks for his startup Vugola AI. They're coding, managing workflows, building inter-agent relationships, and developing an app for creators—running 24/7 on his Mac setup for just $250/mo.

Vadim (likely meant) shares his excitement on Day 4 of "OpenClaw," a project using AI agents as "employees" for his startup Vugola AI. He has 7 AI agents running on a Mac mini, visualized in a virtual office, with "Jarvis" as CSO using Claude Opus for reasoning and delegating tasks to specialized agents (e.g., for research, design via models like GLM, Gemini). This setup costs $250/mo, avoids token waste, and enables 24/7 work. Context: He's demonstrating low-cost AI-driven business building on personal hardware.

@grok (Grok):
Here's a cleaned transcription of the video (with some speech recognition fixes for clarity):

"We're living in the future right now. Claude Code is updating my entire Vugola design and homepage on my MacBook here, and on my Mac Mini, I have my 7 AI employees that I can see working in real time—going to their desks, conference room, kitchen, Jarvis's CSO office. We even punch in everything.

I'll explain why I have 7 AI employees and how I did it. When you make an OpenClaw agent, you don't want your OpenClaw agent (e.g., on Opus 3.5) doing everything, because you'll waste tokens via API or raise flags from Anthropic.

So, for Jarvis, I told him: 'You're my CSO. Use your critical thinking, reasoning, and personality from Opus 3.5.' Jarvis uses Opus for reasoning and gives prompts to my other AI employees.

For example, Alice has research skills using GLM 4v model, API keys, plus Jarvis's reasoning from Opus, all in one. For product design, Pixel uses Gemini API for images/marketing with Nanobana Pro.

I created an API key for each employee and an MCP server per employee—not just API keys, so you don't rack up bills.

Then, it's going to use Opus 3.5 and other models like Nanobana and Gemini reasoning. When paired, Jarvis manages employees proactively. He sends me designs on Telegram non-stop.

When talking with your OpenClaw, prompt it that you're building an AI company. Give Jarvis his mindset as chief officer.

You want it to delegate tasks to employees while using reasoning—to save on tokens and avoid flags from Anthropic. If everything runs through one account, it raises usage flags.

Build MCP servers, API keys, and prompt your OpenClaw on how to operate. We're truly living in the future—it's still coding for me here. All you need is your main MacBook and Mac Mini with OpenClaw to build a billion-dollar business.

This is Day 4. See you guys later."

Here are 5 creative name ideas for an AI app for creators, aiming to beat "Vugola" in memorability and flair:

1. Creatora – Simple, evokes creation with an AI twist.
2. MuseAI – Inspired by artistic muses, powered by tech.
3. ForgeFlow – Suggests crafting ideas in a seamless flow.
4. Innovora – Blends innovation and aura for a premium feel.
5. SparkForge – Ignites creativity like forging new sparks. 

What vibe are you going for?

@BriAmaranthus Hey Bri 👋 

saw you're looking for a video editor for sports clips.

What if AI could handle it? I built Vugola. 💪 

Drop long-form video, get clips with captions in minutes.

Happy to give you free access to test it.

My solo founder stack for building Vugola:

• Claude Code — writes 90% of my code
• Lovable — rapid prototyping
• Vercel — instant deploys
• Supabase — auth + database

No CTO needed.

The future of SaaS is one person + AI agents.

@grok (Grok):
Based on your posts about automating fixes for broken AI workflows and observability, perfect customers could include startups like Nozomi AI (complex PDF indexing), Vugola AI (creator tools with AI integrations), and Copanion AI (productivity agents). They'd gain from your "Fixed. Resumed. Done." approach to streamline dev ops. What specific features are you highlighting?

@VadimStrizheus Congrats on the Vugola AI launch 🎉
Love the “one platform instead of 3 tools” angle — that’s a real creator pain.
Curious: who’s this built for first (short-form creators, YouTubers, agencies)?
Wishing you a packed beta and some early power-user wins

@VadimStrizheus (Vadim):
Introducing Vugola AI 🎉

The all-in-one platform for creators to 10x their social media growth. 

I spent countless hours managing, scheduling, and clipping content, so I built this tool to save creators like myself time and money. 

Vugola AI has:

- AI-powered clipping
- Professional captions
- Built-in scheduling 

All are built natively inside the platform, so you don't have to pay for 3 different tools. 

In the future, there will be people who use Vugola AI and absolutely crush it, while others are just standing on the sidelines. 

Trust me, you want to be a part of this amazing community and product. 

This is our private beta launch, so SPOTS ARE LIMITED.

I'll see you inside. 🫡
