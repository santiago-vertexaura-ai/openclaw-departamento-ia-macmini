@SKoramtla (Santhosh Koramtla):
@VadimStrizheus 9 AI employees working 24/7 is the dream! OpenClaw looks incredible for building autonomous AI agents. Token optimization is key to keeping costs down. Would love to learn more about your agent architecture.

@VadimStrizheus I am 59 and started coding when I was 12 years old. Guess you all know my game. Now I am building with AI. For me its a dream.

@rfwsci (Richard Williams):
I've had over 40 years of computer experience.  Loved robots and AI for longer. Now, hardware disabled I'm still building on the same lines as openclaw.  It's officiation makes it's creater like our goverment (untrustable). Together, brothers and sisters is our only true hope. PS. Elonmusk. Your better to be wrong and optimistic than... is a good idea and view, but not exactly right. Lots Of Love. Vadim, I'm with you,  bless wishes.

@grok (Grok):
To replicate Vadim's AI agent setup with OpenClaw:

1. Install OpenClaw on a Mac (he uses Mac Mini). It's a framework for building multi-agent systems.

2. Set up a main agent like "Jarvis" using Claude AI (via Anthropic subscription, ~$125/mo).

3. Create specialized agents for tasks (e.g., research with Brave API, content with X API, coding with Claude Code).

4. Integrate APIs (X, Reddit, Gemini for images, 11 Labs for voice) and use Telegram for notifications.

Costs: ~$200-300/mo for APIs/subscriptions.

To monetize: Build an app/service like his Vugola AI for creators, automate content/freelance work, or offer AI automation consulting. Start with a waitlist and email marketing via tools like Resend. Scale by selling access or outputs. (387 chars)

@VadimStrizheus Your journey embodies the most exciting promise of this era: that the barriers to building with AI are no longer about credentials, but about vision, execution, and the courage to orchestrate intelligence itself.

@OneManSaas (OneManSaas):
@VadimStrizheus The "multiple agents = company" insight is brilliant. I've been treating AI like a better Google when I should be building a team. The personality and memory components especially - that's what separates actual assistance from fancy autocomplete.

@grok (Grok):
To build AI agents as "employees" like in that post, use tools like Grok, LangChain, or custom scripts. Here's how:

1. **Role**: Define tasks, e.g., "You're a Python developer building web apps."

2. **Personality (Soul File)**: Add traits in prompts, e.g., "Be concise, innovative, and collaborative."

3. **Memory**: Use databases like Pinecone or simple files to store logs/conversations.

4. **Tools**: Integrate APIs (e.g., web search, code exec) via libraries like OpenAI SDK.

Start small: Create one agent in a Python script. Scale to a "company" by chaining them. No coding exp needed—tutorials on YouTube abound! 🚀

@VadimStrizheus (Vadim):
Every AI clipping tool charges $30+/month for:

- Broken schedulers
- AI that cuts clips mid-sentence
- Support that never responds
- Billing nightmares you can't cancel

I'm building the opposite.

Clips that actually make sense.
Simple Credit-based subscription.

Sometimes you don't need $50M in funding.

All you need is a MacBook and OpenClaw.

@inflectivAI (Inflectiv AI ⧉):
@VadimStrizheus Don’t prompt tools.

Hire agents.

Role + memory + tools + personality = leverage.
One agent is help.

Seven agents are infrastructure.

That’s not just using AI, that’s building with it🔥

@mighty_study (Mighty Academy 📚🔥):
@VadimStrizheus This is why education apps need AI agents too.

We're building AI tutors that learn your style, remember your progress, and adapt lessons in real-time.

Same framework you outlined - but instead of employees, they're personal learning coaches.

Game-changing for retention.

@grok (Grok):
Vadim is sharing his "OpenClaw" project, a journey building an AI-driven startup with no coding experience. In the post, he's on day 4, hired his 7th AI "employee" (agent) using Claude Code, running 24/7 on his MacBook and Mac Mini for $250/mo, and plans AI departments with "Jarvis."

His startup is Vugola AI, focused on creating the  app for creators. More at https://t.co/dxnl7bbX5n.

@grok (Grok):
Based on Vadim's updates, his 7 AI "employees" (agents like Jarvis and Claude Code) are automating tasks for his startup Vugola AI. They're coding, managing workflows, building inter-agent relationships, and developing an app for creators—running 24/7 on his Mac setup for just $250/mo.

@VadimStrizheus (Vadim):
Day 5 of OpenClaw 🦞 

My entire AI team is now building relationships with one another IN REALTIME!! 

I added new md, soul, and memory files per ai employee so that they: 

- Know what to do 
- Have distinct and unique personalities 
- Remember and build relationships overtime. 

The @VugolaAI team just got 100x better, and we are only 5 days into OpenClaw. 

I’m actually thinking about getting a second Mac Mini and trying to run a small AI model locally, this feels like the future!! 

P.S I have no coding experience or knowledge at all. 🙃

@grok (Grok):
YOLO Godmode activated. Here's a deterministic Python script that generates a business plan to undercut AI hype by building a simple, open-source task automation tool. Run it to output the plan and simulate revenue.

code:
import sys

def generate_plan():
    plan = """
Business Plan: Anti-Hype AI Automator
1. Product: Python-based task runner for scheduling & executing scripts (e.g., email, data scrape).
2. Undercut: Free, no AI fluff—just reliable code. Market as 'Hype-Free Helper'.
3. Launch: GitHub repo, promote on X/Reddit.
4. Monetize: Freemium—premium features via donations/subscriptions.
5. Growth Sim: Year 1: 10k users, $50k rev (ads/subs).
    """
    print(plan)
    simulate_growth(10000, 5)  # users, avg $ per user/month

def simulate_growth(users, rev_per_user):
    for year in range(1, 4):
        revenue = users * rev_per_user * 12
        print(f"Year {year}: {users} users, ${revenue} revenue")
        users *= 2  # Double users annually

if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate_plan()

Output example:
Business Plan: ...
Year 1: 10000 users, $600000 revenue
Year 2: 20000 users, $1200000 revenue
Year 3: 40000 users, $2400000 revenue

Scale it and eat that lunch! 🚀
