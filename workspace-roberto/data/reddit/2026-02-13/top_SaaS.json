I just asked \u201chow am I supposed to make that work?\u201d And got the same \u201cthink bigger picture\u201d line from the dad. The dad, by the way, is not a founder. Not an owner. He\u2019s the CEO\u2019s father and the company accountant.\n\nHere\u2019s the part that really got me. The CEO - who actually owns 50% of the company - said \u201cwhat if we met in the middle?\u201d Which honestly? Reasonable.\n\nHer dad said no.\n\nThe person who actually has decision-making authority in this company tried to compromise, and a non-owner shut it down. In front of everyone.\n\nSo after the meeting I went through their full proposed investment agreement line by line. And I found some things:\n\n\u2219\tThe dad wants 20k for doing financial work pertaining to the project but the grant agreement explicitly prohibits payments to related persons.\n\n\u2219\tThe hourly rates the dad proposed for the two cofounders was 50k each.

While I\u2019m the one delivering every single milestone.\n\nAnd the grant clause states that paid labour must be aligned with reasonable market rates and can only be paid if the work is for the milestones.\n\nI left the meeting so I can chat with my lawyer (hired someone on retainer) and get the facts before going into another meeting.\n\nI really went into everything in good faith because the CEO is a good friend. The dad is fucking everything up.\n\nAnyways. I booked another negotiation meeting next week.\n\nMy strategy is to present the grant compliance issues first for leverage because related persons can\u2019t get paid.\n\nAnd the founders can\u2019t get paid 50k each for maybe 5-10 hours a month. That would put their hourly rate at 250-over 500 dollars per hour.\n\nThat\u2019s would be above reasonable rates and directly conflict and would cause a red flag on how paying them 500 dollars per hour would contribute to the milestones.\n\nThat\u2019s not ok.\n\nI am decently connected in the tech space in my local area. I can easily shop this around and get funding elsewhere cause I\u2019ve already proved this is a validated product.\n\nI ain\u2019t no bitch so I\u2019m gonna try to work things out one more time.\n\nIf they come back reasonable, great.

of them were terrible. but the ones who made it were some of the best devs ive ever worked with. better than local hires at 3x the price\n\nthe problem isnt that offshore devs are bad. the problem is that most people dont know how to vet them. they post a job, pick whoever sounds good on upwork, and then act surprised when the code is garbage and communication is a nightmare.\n\nheres the exact process i use now. took me a long time and a lot of expensive mistakes to figure this out.\n\n**step 1: cast a wide net and autofilter**\n\ni post the job and get 100+ applicants. most are obvious nos from their profile alone. the ones that look promising get a message:\n\n\"we reviewed your application and we're seriously impressed. only 4% of applicants receive this message. please fill out this form and once we have your info we'll reach out for a final interview.\"\n\nit works because it makes people feel selected, which means they actually put effort into the next step.\n\nthe form asks for name, email, and a 2 minute loom video answering role specific questions. the loom video is the secret weapon here. you can disqualify 95% of people in the first 3 seconds. bad audio, skip. reading off a script word for word, skip. cant explain a basic concept clearly, skip. you can rip through 100 loom videos in an afternoon.\n\n100+ applicants turns into maybe 10 worth talking to.\n\n**step 2: interview for communication not just code**\n\nthose 10 get a real interview. but im not asking leetcode questions. i care way more about how they think through problems and how they communicate tradeoffs. can they tell me \"thats a bad idea, heres a cheaper way to do it\"? thats what i want. a dev who just says yes to everything will cost you 10x more in the long run.\n\n**step 3: paid skill test**\n\nthis is important. paid. not free. if youre asking someone to do hours of work to prove themselves, pay them for it. its like $50 to $100 and it filters out the people who cant actually deliver under realistic conditions. its also just the right thing to do.\n\n**step 4: paid trial week**\n\none week, real tasks, real communication expectations. this is where you find out if they disappear for 6 hours without updating you or if they flag blockers early. technical skills got them here. communication and reliability is what gets them the offer.\n\nthen one offer. maybe two if youre scaling.\n\n**ok so why go through all this?**\n\na good offshore dev costs $10 to $20/hr. for roughly $2k a month you can have a great developer building, iterating, and maintaining your product continuously. not a one time mvp that collects dust but an actual ongoing development cycle where youre shipping improvements based on real user feedback every week\n\ncompare that to a local agency quoting you $30k+ for a static deliverable or trying to find a technical cofounder for 8 months\n\ni kept seeing non technical founders either overpay massively for development or get burned by random upwork hires. so this vetting process eventually became its own thing. i now run talero (talero.co) where i basically do this entire process for founders who need a dev but dont know how to evaluate one\n\nbut honestly even if you never use a service like mine, just adding the loom video step to your hiring process will save you dozens of hours. its the single highest ROI filter ive

"I\u2019ve been involved in growth for a large women\u2019s health app (period tracking, ovulation prediction, pregnancy guidance), and earlier this year we ran a focused authority-building

backlinks built\n* \\-Significant increase in traffic value\n\nNow, 16% growth on a 2M+ base isn\u2019t easy - especially in health.\n\nBecause this is medical/fertility content, it falls under Google\u2019s YMYL guidelines (high scrutiny, strict E-E-A-T expectations). Shortcuts would have backfired.\n\nWe handle most growth in-house, but for this specific push we decided to bring in an [external SEO/link-building partner](http://submittodirectory.com) to handle outreach at scale.\n\nThe goal wasn\u2019t volume - it was consistent, high-quality placements in a sensitive (YMYL) niche.\n\n**The competitive landscape**\n\nWe were competing with platforms like:\n\n* Clue\n* Natural Cycles\n* Everyday Health\n\nHealth SERPs are extremely competitive and heavily trust-driven.\n\n**What actually moved rankings**\n\n**1. Relevance over volume**\n\nOnly 32 links in 2 months.\n\nBut they were contextual and topically aligned with fertility, pregnancy, and data-backed health resources.\n\nSome placements included sites like:\n\n* GWI\n* Superprof\n\nNo mass guest posting. No spam directories.\n\n**2. Utility pages were the growth lever**\n\nInstead of pushing general blog content, we focused on strengthening:\n\n* Pregnancy probability calculators\n* Ovulation prediction tools\n* \u201cAm I pregnant?\u201d resources\n\nUtility-based pages tend to attract citations naturally when structured well.\n\n**3. E-E-A-T alignment**\n\nFor medical niches, we made sure:\n\n* Content was expert-reviewed\n* Authors were clearly attributed\n* Medical claims were conservative and sourced\n* Anchor strategy remained natural\n\nAggressive tactics would have hurt more than helped.\n\n**Ranking impact**\n\nDuring the campaign, the app ranked top 3 for competitive queries like:\n\n* Early pregnancy symptoms\n* When to take pregnancy test\n* Track my period\n* Early signs of pregnancy\n\nOrganic traffic value also increased significantly during this window.\n\n**Biggest takeaway for app founders**\n\nAt scale (1M+ traffic), growth rarely comes from \u201cmore content.\u201d\n\nIt comes from:\n\n* Authority stacking\n* Strengthening high-intent pages\n* Precision link acquisition\n* Protecting trust signals\n\nShort, focused campaigns can work - but only if the foundation is already strong.\n\nCurious for other app operators here:\n\nIs SEO still a major growth lever for you, or have paid channels taken over as your primary acquisition engine?\n\nHappy to share more specifics if helpful.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5kebtsml53jg1.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15222ff94435ffc3e039bfd821b448b36ae4fec1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a9cn5tml53jg1.png?width=419&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e254e8fdd09e69c0469e1c6971f66a33fedafdbe", "author_fullname": "t2_1j9dwg7c3f", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "We added ~466k monthly organic visitors to a women\u2019s health app in 2 months", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SaaS", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 78, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"5kebtsml53jg1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 60, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5kebtsml53jg1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2243a15e8935215ca0a841a8e8005a407f0c55ce"}, {"y": 120, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5kebtsml53jg1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61899b9ce94be18e72e60ed1790ddb5cf2d16d57"}, {"y": 178, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5kebtsml53jg1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2aabfe6ac25c4267f6fdec2fd6e0c78c8ef52b59"}], "s": {"y": 265, "x": 474, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/5kebtsml53jg1.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15222ff94435ffc3e039bfd821b448b36ae4fec1"}, "id": "5kebtsml53jg1"}, "a9cn5tml53jg1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 67, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a9cn5tml53jg1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76781d433130234e17de43603b756a0f013d8fa4"}, {"y": 135, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a9cn5tml53jg1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2f6237ea08c9693a83ecc84e319aa0653dc60bf"}, {"y": 200, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a9cn5tml53jg1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b7b56c4f6ca67e64cd42e9f3b9eebb148b6c11f"}], "s": {"y": 262, "x": 419, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/a9cn5tml53jg1.png?width=419&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e254e8fdd09e69c0469e1c6971f66a33fedafdbe"}, "id": "a9cn5tml53jg1"}}, "name": "t3_1r2x36w", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 24, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": null, "can_mod_post": false, "score": 24, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/5kebtsml53jg1.png?width=140&amp;height=78&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9f75348b9ffabd88f1d88e4389b77bc75d91145", "edited": 1770912270.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1770911701.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.SaaS", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve been involved in growth for a large women\u2019s health app (period tracking, ovulation prediction, pregnancy guidance), and earlier this year we ran a focused authority-building push.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting point:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;~2.3M monthly organic visitors&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;~490k ranking keywords&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;DR ~75&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 2 months:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;~2.77M monthly visitors (+16.8%)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;726k ranking keywords&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;32 backlinks built&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;-Significant increase in traffic value&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, 16% growth on a 2M+ base isn\u2019t easy -
