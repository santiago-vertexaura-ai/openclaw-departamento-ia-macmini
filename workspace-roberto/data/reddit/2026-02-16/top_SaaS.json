The #1 pattern: distribution beats product every time. Not a single founder credited product quality as their primary growth driver. Reddit and SEO were the most common channels (37% of founders). I open sourced all 17 playbooks as a Claude Code skill you can query from your terminal.\n\nI'm a systems engineer by day. I reverse engineer things for a living. It's how my brain works. I can't just consume something, I have to pull it apart.\n\nSo when I found Starter Story and started watching founder interviews, I couldn't just watch. I had to extract the blueprint.\n\nI saved 19 interviews (every recent episode featuring a founder making $10K-$200K+ MRR) to a knowledge management tool I'm building, extracted the transcripts, and ran cross-content analysis to find what's repeatable vs what's unique.\n\nHere's what I found.\n\n# The #1 Pattern: Distribution &gt; Product\n\nEvery founder who grew fast had a distribution strategy before or alongside building. The ones who struggled built first, then scrambled for users.\n\nThis wasn't most founders. This was all 19.\n\nThe biggest surprise: not a single founder credited product quality as their primary growth driver. Every one pointed to distribution first. Even the founders with genuinely great products. They'll tell you distribution is what moved the needle.\n\n# Distribution Channels Ranked by Speed-to-Revenue\n\n# Tier 1: Fastest to $10K MRR\n\n**Reddit** \\- Roman (Goji Berry AI - that we've all seen here) went from $2K to $34K MRR in 6 months using Reddit alone. Generated 11M impressions and 40K+ website visitors.\n\nHis system:\n\n* Warm up accounts 7-14 days (comment and upvote only, zero marketing)\n* Post authentic stories with proof: screenshots, revenue dashboards, real numbers\n* Get 10+ upvotes in first 10 minutes (he coordinated with 15 friendly marketers)\n* Reply to every single comment\n* Never put the SaaS link directly in the post. Trigger curiosity instead.\n* Turn any life event into content: \"Got rejected from YC? Post about it. Paid 5 influencers and it flopped? Post about it.\"\n\n**TikTok** \\- Louis (GlowUp AI) validated his idea through TikTok comments BEFORE building anything. He read thousands of makeup TikTok comments to find pain points, created content about the solution, and only built the app after the content went viral. Scaled to 7 accounts posting 8-12x daily. $800K in year one. His rule: \"Content before code. If it goes viral, build the app.\"\n\n**Discord** \\- Sam (Algrow) found niche communities on discboard.org, joined voice chats, and screen-shared his tool without even talking. Just showing it solving problems in real time. Built rapport through genuine helpfulness. Community owners organically promoted him. $0 to $14K MRR. His take: \"Discord is 10x better than email for building relationships with users.\"\n\n**Partnerships** \\- Hassam (LaunchFast) had zero audience. He identified a coaching company that already had his target customers, built a demo in 48 hours with Cursor, and sent it over: \"Give me 48 hours. If you like it, we partner. No strings attached.\" Gave up equity for instant distribution. $0 to $25K MRR in 90 days. His math: \"50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.\"\n\n# Tier 2: Sustainable Growth ($10K \u2192 $100K+ MRR)\n\n**SEO + Content Marketing** \\- Mike ($200K MRR across 5 apps) was the loudest voice here: \"It is never, ever, ever, ever too early to start writing content.\" His playbook: write competitor comparison pages (\"X vs Y\"), \"alternative to\" pages, and publish consistently. The content compounds. The longer it's live, the more Google and AI search tools index it. He funds 1-2 years of content production using LTD capital (more on that below).\n\n**Influencer Marketing** \\- George (Wrestle AI, $17K MRR) DM'd 100 influencers per day. First words: \"Paid promo?\" Influencers skip everything else. Always negotiate on phone, never in DMs. Deal structure: 20-50% upfront, 4-5 videos, view guarantee at $2-5 CPM. He scaled from $0 to $17K MRR on roughly $500/month in influencer spend.\n\n**Building in Public** \\- Rob (SuperX, $10K MRR) and Tibo ($700K/month across 5 products) both grew by sharing progress on Twitter/X. Tibo routed all customer support to Twitter DMs until each product hit $10K MRR. Builds real relationships and creates advocates who share your product for you.\n\n# Channel Frequency Across All 19 Founders\n\n* Reddit: 37%\n* SEO/Content: 37%\n* TikTok/Short-form video: 32%\n* Twitter/X (building in public): 32%\n* Influencer/UGC marketing: 26%\n* Paid ads: 21%\n\nMost successful founders used 2-3 channels max and went all in on what worked.\n\n# The Two Playbooks\n\nTwo distinct frameworks emerged from the data:\n\n# Playbook A: The Methodical B2B SaaS Playbook\n\n**Best for:** SaaS tools, B2B products, productivity software **Timeline:** 6-18 months to $10K MRR **Source:** Mike ($200K MRR) and Tibo ($700K/month)\n\nThe condensed version:\n\n1. Pick a proven idea. Something that exists but has bad UX. 17 of 19 founders explicitly said do NOT chase novel ideas.\n2. MVP in days, not months. Take shortcuts, use boilerplates, use AI tools.\n3. Launch a private Lifetime Deal ($59-100) in Reddit groups, Facebook groups, LTD communities. Goal: raise \\~$30K.\n4. Never give away free accounts. If people pay, they use it and give feedback.\n5. Launch on AppSumo for massive reach. Goal is to close LTD phase with $100K in the bank.\n6. Start writing SEO content immediately. Competitor comparison pages, \"alternative to\" pages.\n7. LTD users become your review army (G2, TrustPilot). They want you to succeed.\n8. Transition to MRR once content compounds and organic traffic replaces LTD runway.\n\nThe LTD strategy is worth highlighting because it's brilliant: you raise $50-100K in capital, get hundreds of users giving feedback and writing reviews, and fund your content engine for 1-2 years. Then you close the LTD forever and move to monthly pricing. Mike's done this with 5 products.\n\n# Playbook B: The Content-First Mobile/B2C Playbook\n\n**Best for:** Mobile apps, B2C, visual/consumer products **Timeline:** 1-3 months to $10K MRR (faster but more volatile) **Source:** Louis ($800K/year), George ($17K MRR), Connor ($20K MRR)\n\nThe condensed version:\n\n1. Mine TikTok/Instagram comments for pain points people literally type out.\n2. Create content about the solution BEFORE building anything.\n3. If content goes viral, you've validated the idea. Build the MVP fast.\n4. Scale content: start at 1 post/day, then 4-6x/day when you see traction, then multiple accounts.\n5. Add anchor links (download buttons) only once videos hit 500K+ views. Adding them too early kills the video.\n6. Build referral loops: \"Invite 3 friends = free feature\" - users return to viral videos to share referral codes in comments, which boosts engagement, drives more views, drives more downloads.\n7. Layer in influencer marketing once you have traction.\n\nGeorge had a useful framework he called the \"gotcha moment.\" Every successful app needs something that stops the scroll and conveys value in 5 seconds. He said it was in the back of his mind during every design decision.\n\n# The Idea Selection Pattern\n\nThis one surprised me. 17 of 19 founders explicitly said to pick proven ideas, not novel ones.\n\nMike ($200K MRR): \"Pick an idea that's been done before. New ideas are risky. If you pick an idea that's been done before, you know that people want it.\"\n\nTibo ($700K/month): \"You will have a 90% failure rate. If you find a way to compress that in weeks, you're going to reach success much much faster.\"\n\nDavid ($12K MRR): literally found a successful app, made it 1% different, and launched.\n\nHow they found ideas:\n\n* **Personal frustration** \\- Hassam spent 20-30 hrs/week on Amazon research manually, built a tool to automate it\n* **TikTok comment mining** \\- Louis read thousands of comments to find pain points\n* **Discord chat history** \\- Sam copy-pasted days of chat into ChatGPT: \"List all pain points discussed\"\n* **Competitor analysis** \\- Pontus used Ahrefs to find apps with organic + paid traffic (strong signal), then built better versions\n* **Free tools as validation** \\- Bhanu (SiteGPT, $13K MRR) built 50+ free tools driving 50K monthly visitors from Google. 90% of his traffic comes from free tools, not the main product.\n\n# The Contrarian Takes\n\nNot everyone agreed on everything. A few founders pushed back on the dominant patterns:\n\n* **Mike** ($200K MRR): \"We will never go after an AI focused business.\" He avoids building on APIs he doesn't control. Notable given that most founders in the dataset lean heavily on OpenAI/Claude APIs.\n* **George** ($17K MRR): \"Distribution doesn't matter if you don't have a viral idea.\" Pushes back on the \"distribution &gt; product\" narrative. He argues the product concept itself needs viral potential baked in.\n* **Louis** ($800K): \"You don't have to love the idea. Makeup is not my passion. It's my capitalistic endeavor.\" Separates passion from business.\n\n# Revenue Mechanics That Work\n\nCommon milestones across the dataset:\n\n* $0 to $1K MRR: 1-4 weeks (with a distribution strategy in place)\n* $1K to $10K MRR: 1-3 months (organic channels: Reddit, TikTok, Discord)\n* $10K to $50K MRR: 3-12 months (add SEO, ads, affiliates)\n* $50K to $100K+: 6-24 months (scale what works, kill what doesn't)\n\nInfrastructure costs across all 19: roughly $100-400/month to run a $10K+ MRR business. The default stack in 2025-2026 is Next.js + Supabase + Vercel + Stripe + Cursor or Claude Code.\n\nThe portfolio approach came up repeatedly. Tibo runs 5 apps ($700K/month combined), Mike runs 5 apps ($200K MRR), Katie runs 20 WordPress plugins ($150K/month). If one dies, the others survive.\n\n# What I'm Doing With This\n\nI taught myself to code in my 30s. Now I'm trying to build different products and launch. I built a knowledge management tool and used it to run this entire analysis. Saved all 19 videos, extracted transcripts, ran cross-content analysis to find the patterns.\n\nThen I turned every finding into an open source Claude Code skill. 17 playbooks you can install and query from your terminal while you're building. Ask \"how do I get my first users for a B2B SaaS?\" and it pulls the specific founder tactics with real numbers.\n\n**Open source:** [https://github.com/drewautomates/solo-builder-playbook-skill](https://github.com/drewautomates/solo-builder-playbook-skill)\n\nNow I'm applying these playbooks to my own growth. Starting with Reddit (hi), SEO content, and building in public. This isn't theoretical. It's my roadmap, and I'm following it in public.\n\n**If you're building right now: what distribution channel are you betting on?**\n\nThe data says most successful founders use 2-3 channels max and go all in on what works.

He scaled from $0 to $17K MRR on roughly $500/month in influencer spend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building in Public&lt;/strong&gt; - Rob (SuperX, $10K MRR) and Tibo ($700K/month across 5 products) both grew by sharing progress on Twitter/X. Tibo routed all customer support to Twitter DMs until each product hit $10K MRR. Builds real relationships and creates advocates who share your product for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Channel Frequency Across All 19 Founders&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reddit: 37%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SEO/Content: 37%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;TikTok/Short-form video: 32%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Twitter/X (building in public): 32%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Influencer/UGC marketing: 26%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Paid ads: 21%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most successful founders used 2-3 channels max and went all in on what worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Two Playbooks&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two distinct frameworks emerged from the data:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Playbook A: The Methodical B2B SaaS Playbook&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for:&lt;/strong&gt; SaaS tools, B2B products, productivity software &lt;strong&gt;Timeline:&lt;/strong&gt; 6-18 months to $10K MRR &lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt; Mike ($200K MRR) and Tibo ($700K/month)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The condensed version:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pick a proven idea. Something that exists but has bad UX. 17 of 19 founders explicitly said do NOT chase novel ideas.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;MVP in days, not months. Take shortcuts, use boilerplates, use AI tools.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Launch a private Lifetime Deal ($59-100) in Reddit groups, Facebook groups, LTD communities. Goal: raise ~$30K.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Never give away free accounts. If people pay, they use it and give feedback.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Launch on AppSumo for massive reach. Goal is to close LTD phase with $100K in the bank.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Start writing SEO content immediately. Competitor comparison pages, &amp;quot;alternative to&amp;quot; pages.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;LTD users become your review army (G2, TrustPilot). They want you to succeed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Transition to MRR once content compounds and organic traffic replaces LTD runway.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The LTD strategy is worth highlighting because it&amp;#39;s brilliant: you raise $50-100K in capital, get hundreds of users giving feedback and writing reviews, and fund your content engine for 1-2 years. Then you close the LTD forever and move to monthly pricing. Mike&amp;#39;s done this with 5 products.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Playbook B: The Content-First Mobile/B2C Playbook&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for:&lt;/strong&gt; Mobile apps, B2C, visual/consumer products &lt;strong&gt;Timeline:&lt;/strong&gt; 1-3 months to $10K MRR (faster but more volatile) &lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt; Louis ($800K/year), George ($17K MRR), Connor ($20K MRR)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The condensed version:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mine TikTok/Instagram comments for pain points people literally type out.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create content about the solution BEFORE building anything.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If content goes viral, you&amp;#39;ve validated the idea. Build the MVP fast.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scale content: start at 1 post/day, then 4-6x/day when you see traction, then multiple accounts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add anchor links (download buttons) only once videos hit 500K+ views. Adding them too early kills the video.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build referral loops: &amp;quot;Invite 3 friends = free feature&amp;quot; - users return to viral videos to share referral codes in comments, which boosts engagement, drives more views, drives more downloads.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Layer in influencer marketing once you have traction.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;George had a useful framework he called the &amp;quot;gotcha moment.&amp;quot; Every successful app needs something that stops the scroll and conveys value in 5 seconds. He said it was in the back of his mind during every design decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Idea Selection Pattern&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This one surprised me. 17 of 19 founders explicitly said to pick proven ideas, not novel ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike ($200K MRR): &amp;quot;Pick an idea that&amp;#39;s been done before. New ideas are risky. If you pick an idea that&amp;#39;s been done before, you know that people want it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tibo ($700K/month): &amp;quot;You will have a 90% failure rate. If you find a way to compress that in weeks, you&amp;#39;re going to reach success much much faster.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;David ($12K MRR): literally found a successful app, made it 1% different, and launched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How they found ideas:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal frustration&lt;/strong&gt; - Hassam spent 20-30 hrs/week on Amazon research manually, built a tool to automate it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TikTok comment mining&lt;/strong&gt; - Louis read thousands of comments to find pain points&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discord chat history&lt;/strong&gt; - Sam copy-pasted days of chat into ChatGPT: &amp;quot;List all pain points discussed&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitor analysis&lt;/strong&gt; - Pontus used Ahrefs to find apps with organic + paid traffic (strong signal), then built better versions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free tools as validation&lt;/strong&gt; - Bhanu (SiteGPT, $13K MRR) built 50+ free tools driving 50K monthly visitors from Google. 90% of his traffic comes from free tools, not the main product.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Contrarian Takes&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not everyone agreed on everything. A few founders pushed back on the dominant patterns:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike&lt;/strong&gt; ($200K MRR): &amp;quot;We will never go after an AI focused business.&amp;quot; He avoids building on APIs he doesn&amp;#39;t control. Notable given that most founders in the dataset lean heavily on OpenAI/Claude APIs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;George&lt;/strong&gt; ($17K MRR): &amp;quot;Distribution doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you don&amp;#39;t have a viral idea.&amp;quot; Pushes back on the &amp;quot;distribution &amp;gt; product&amp;quot; narrative. He argues the product concept itself needs viral potential baked in.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Louis&lt;/strong&gt; ($800K): &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t have to love the idea. Makeup is not my passion. It&amp;#39;s my capitalistic endeavor.&amp;quot; Separates passion from business.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Revenue Mechanics That Work&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Common milestones across the dataset:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;$0 to $1K MRR: 1-4 weeks (with a distribution strategy in place)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;$1K to $10K MRR: 1-3 months (organic channels: Reddit, TikTok, Discord)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;$10K to $50K MRR: 3-12 months (add SEO, ads, affiliates)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;$50K to $100K+: 6-24 months (scale what works, kill what doesn&amp;#39;t)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure costs across all 19: roughly $100-400/month to run a $10K+ MRR business. The default stack in 2025-2026 is Next.js + Supabase + Vercel + Stripe + Cursor or Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The portfolio approach came up repeatedly. Tibo runs 5 apps ($700K/month combined), Mike runs 5 apps ($200K MRR), Katie runs 20 WordPress plugins ($150K/month). If one dies, the others survive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What I&amp;#39;m Doing With This&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I taught myself to code in my 30s. Now I&amp;#39;m trying to build different products and launch. I built a knowledge management tool and used it to run this entire analysis. Saved all 19 videos, extracted transcripts, ran cross-content analysis to find the patterns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I turned every finding into an open source Claude Code skill. 17 playbooks you can install and query from your terminal while you&amp;#39;re building. Ask &amp;quot;how do I get my first users for a B2B SaaS?&amp;quot; and it pulls the specific founder tactics with real numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open source:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/drewautomates/solo-builder-playbook-skill\"&gt;https://github.com/drewautomates/solo-builder-playbook-skill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m applying these playbooks to my own growth. Starting with Reddit (hi), SEO content, and building in public. This isn&amp;#39;t theoretical. It&amp;#39;s my roadmap, and I&amp;#39;m following it in public.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you&amp;#39;re building right now: what distribution channel are you betting on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The data says most successful founders use 2-3 channels max and go all in on what works. Genuinely curious what&amp;#39;s working for people here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/raeDKybrPlCeK9huPqibs8vxzmeZhVo0t_aX7_RnomQ.png?auto=webp&amp;s=0c4a1e06ebaf5adaa7b4738133c920f9f87348b3", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/raeDKybrPlCeK9huPqibs8vxzmeZhVo0t_aX7_RnomQ.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f61c91288c882d3069c6cca936ea8655c3ada82", "width": 108, "height": 54}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/raeDKybrPlCeK9huPqibs8vxzmeZhVo0t_aX7_RnomQ.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f1af43f5afd667d9e44494ea7c565a5d43ee569", "width": 216, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/raeDKybrPlCeK9huPqibs8vxzmeZhVo0t_aX7_RnomQ.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55fbf3218c847cb929dfc3cecf251ddc65f8c0ff", "width": 320, "height": 160}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/raeDKybrPlCeK9huPqibs8vxzmeZhVo0t_aX7_RnomQ.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=674da7cb90de550e810901e7984131b597a2daf3", "width": 640, "height": 320}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/raeDKybrPlCeK9huPqibs8vxzmeZhVo0t_aX7_RnomQ.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12ececd63c8205408001f3fb86c5b901b465698", "width": 960, "height": 480}, {"url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/raeDKybrPlCeK9huPqibs8vxzmeZhVo0t_aX7_RnomQ.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=316f1d7b6273c0b100bf9b5691c3a606ed0fc650", "width": 1080, "height": 540}], "variants": {}, "id": "raeDKybrPlCeK9huPqibs8vxzmeZhVo0t_aX7_RnomQ"}], "enabled": false}, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qkq6", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "id": "1r5u6qu", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "drewautomates", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 45, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/SaaS/comments/1r5u6qu/i_analyzed_19_starter_story_interviews_to_find/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1r5u6qu/i_analyzed_19_starter_story_interviews_to_find/", "subreddit_subscribers": 566621, "created_utc": 1771199899.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "SaaS", "selftext": "Curious to know \u2014 what tools are you currently paying for (SaaS, dev tools, marketing, CRM, AI, analytics, etc.) that you suspect might have a cheaper or more efficient alternative?\n\nNot looking to shame any tools \u2014 just trying to learn:\n\nWhat feels overpriced?\n\nWhat\u2019s worth it despite the price?\n\nWhat did you switch from and to?\n\nAny hidden gems that saved you serious money?\n\nWould love to hear real experiences (especially from bootstrapped startups)", "author_fullname": "t2_1er1iiqzx7", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "What software are you paying for that probably has a cheaper (or better) alternative?

Not one.  \n\u2022 Several expensive enterprise tools (NeverBounce, MillionVerifier) performed worse than free alternatives\n\n**The biggest surprises:**  \n\u2022 **Emailnator is basically undetectable.** It generates addresses using real Gmail-based domains, so almost every checker treats them as legitimate. Only \\~2 out of 17 services caught it. If you're relying on email verification to prevent abuse, Emailnator is walking right through your front door.  \n\u2022 **Mails\\[.org\\] fooled 14 out of 17 services.** It looks like a real email provider and most blocklists haven't caught up.  \n\u2022 **\"Risky\" is a cop-out.** A bunch of services returned \"risky\" or \"uncertain\" instead of actually flagging disposable emails. Cool, so now I get to write the logic to decide what \"risky\" means? That's literally your one job.  \n\u2022 **Price has zero correlation with accuracy.** Some of the worst performers are the most expensive. Some of the best are cheap or free.  \n\u2022 **Static blocklists are dead.** Any service that just maintains a list of known disposable domains is fighting the last war. These temp mail providers rotate domains constantly. The services that performed well are clearly doing some kind of real-time analysis beyond just checking a list.\n\n**Full rankings:**\n\n|Service|Score|\n|:-|:-|\n|VerifySwift (mine)|16/16|\n|TempMailDetector|14/16|\n|VerifyMail|14/16|\n|Reoon|\\~14/16|\n|UserCheck|13/16|\n|EmailListVerify|13/16|\n|ZeroBounce|\\~12/16|\n|Bouncer|\\~12/16|\n|Emailable|\\~11/16|\n|DeBounce|10/16|\n|IsFakeMail|9/16|\n|Unwrap|9/16|\n|QuickEmailVerification|\\~8/16|\n|NeverBounce|\\~8/16|\n|BounceBan|\\~5/16|\n|MillionVerifier|\\~4/16|\n|WhoisXML|0/16|\n\n**The only service that detected all 16/16 was one I built myself** (I'll be upfront about that). I was frustrated enough by the poor results from existing tools that **I built a free disposable email checker and made it open for anyone to use** \\- no signup, no API key, just a one-line script tag you drop into your forms. If you want to try it, the tool is on the website shown in the infographic.\n\nI provided the full comparison matrix as an image so you can see every result for every service. The test was done January 25, 2026 and the full video recording is available on the tool's page. Results could change over time as services update their databases.

Not one.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u2022 Several expensive enterprise tools (NeverBounce, MillionVerifier) performed worse than free alternatives&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The biggest surprises:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n\u2022 &lt;strong&gt;Emailnator is basically undetectable.&lt;/strong&gt; It generates addresses using real Gmail-based domains, so almost every checker treats them as legitimate. Only ~2 out of 17 services caught it. If you&amp;#39;re relying on email verification to prevent abuse, Emailnator is walking right through your front door.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u2022 &lt;strong&gt;Mails[.org] fooled 14 out of 17 services.&lt;/strong&gt; It looks like a real email provider and most blocklists haven&amp;#39;t caught up.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u2022 &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Risky&amp;quot; is a cop-out.&lt;/strong&gt; A bunch of services returned &amp;quot;risky&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;uncertain&amp;quot; instead of actually flagging disposable emails. Cool, so now I get to write the logic to decide what &amp;quot;risky&amp;quot; means? That&amp;#39;s literally your one job.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u2022 &lt;strong&gt;Price has zero correlation with accuracy.&lt;/strong&gt; Some of the worst performers are the most expensive. Some of the best are cheap or free.&lt;br/&gt;\n\u2022 &lt;strong&gt;Static blocklists are dead.&lt;/strong&gt; Any service that just maintains a list of known disposable domains is fighting the last war. These temp mail providers rotate domains constantly. The services that performed well are clearly doing some kind of real-time analysis beyond just checking a list.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full rankings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Service&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Score&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;VerifySwift (mine)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;16/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;TempMailDetector&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;14/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;VerifyMail&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;14/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Reoon&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;~14/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;UserCheck&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;13/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;EmailListVerify&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;13/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;ZeroBounce&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;~12/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Bouncer&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;~12/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Emailable&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;~11/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;DeBounce&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;10/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;IsFakeMail&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;9/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Unwrap&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;9/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;QuickEmailVerification&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;~8/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;NeverBounce&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;~8/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;BounceBan&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;~5/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;MillionVerifier&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;~4/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;WhoisXML&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;0/16&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only service that detected all 16/16 was one I built myself&lt;/strong&gt; (I&amp;#39;ll be upfront about that). I was frustrated enough by the poor results from existing tools that &lt;strong&gt;I built a free disposable email checker and made it open for anyone to use&lt;/strong&gt; - no signup, no API key, just a one-line script tag you drop into your forms. If you want to try it, the tool is on the website shown in the infographic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I provided the full comparison matrix as an image so you can see every result for every service. The test was done January 25, 2026 and the full video recording is available on the tool&amp;#39;s page. Results could change over time as services update their databases. This is a snapshot, not a permanent verdict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy to answer any questions.
