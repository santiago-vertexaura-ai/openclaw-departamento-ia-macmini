And it's costing them their best growth channel.\n\n1,400 paying subscribers. Zero ad spend. \n\nMy videos average 100-200 views. I recently broke this system down on \n\n[Starter Story](https://youtu.be/W48emwbUlUE?si=fWaV7ItogeOGGmWY)\n\nYouTube isn't a views game. It's a search engine. And if you treat it like one, even tiny view counts can drive serious revenue.\n\nI'm going to break down the exact system what I call the Content Flywheel Growth Engine   \nand fuel for this engine is Customer Pain\n\n# Why low-view videos outperform viral content for SaaS\n\nHere's the core insight:\n\n&gt;100 views from people actively searching for a solution are worth more than 100,000 views from people passively scrolling.\n\nWhen someone searches \"how to create a full wrap mug mockup in Photoshop\" at 2 AM, they're not browsing. They have a problem right now. If your video solves it, they don't just watch, they buy.\n\nThis is the difference between content-for-audience and content-for-customers. Almost every YouTube strategy you see online is optimizing for the first. SaaS founders should be optimizing for the second.\n\nHere's what this looks like in practice: 63% of my YouTube views come from search. Of that, 26% comes from Google directly, not YouTube's own search bar.   \n  \n\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDGO-xbkAECPMV.jpg)\n\n63% People coming for search. 26.4% coming from google search\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDHBQZbwAAWg0B.jpg)\n\nGoogle Search accounts for 73% of external search\n\nPeople are Googling their problem, my video appears in the results, they watch it, and they become customers.\n\nThe videos don't go viral. They go useful. And useful compounds in a way that viral never does.\n\n# The Customer Pain Content Flywheel\n\nThe system has three steps, and each step feeds the next:\n\n1. Harvest customer pain.\n2. Turn pain into tutorials.\n3. Turn tutorials into search assets.\n\nThen the assets bring new customers, who bring new pain, and the cycle compounds.\n\n# Step 1: Harvest customer pain\n\nDon't brainstorm content ideas. Harvest them.\n\nEvery piece of content should come from a real person with a real problem. There are four places to find them:\n\n1. Communities where your customers already hang out.\n\nFacebook groups, Skool communities, Discord servers, Reddit.\n\nDon't go there to promote. Observe. Look for:\n\n* Questions that repeat every few days\n* Posts with unusually high engagement\n* Long comment threads, these signal unresolved pain\n\nEvery repeated problem goes into a running list. That list is your content calendar.\n\n2. New user onboarding emails.\n\nAs soon as someone signs up, send an email asking if they want a custom tutorial for their use case.\n\nMost founders would never do this for a low-priced, self-serve product. But here's what happens: users reply describing exactly what they're trying to do, where they're stuck, and what confuses them.\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDIDgVbIAIaSyJ.jpg)\n\nThey hand you longtail content ideas for free.\n\nThe key is framing: \"Want me to make a tutorial for your specific use case?\" gets honest responses. A generic feedback survey doesn't.\n\n3. Support tickets and live conversations.\n\nThis is probably the highest value source of all.\n\nWhen a customer reaches out, don't just resolve the ticket. Ask them to share their actual files. Then record a screen share tutorial solving their specific problem.\n\nDo this consistently and you'll build a library of private support recordings, real edge cases, real language, real frustrations that never show up in keyword tools.\n\nOver time, I've recorded 1,500+ of these.\n\nMany of my best public tutorials are simply cleanedup versions of private support videos. The content already exists. You're just making it public.\n\n4. YouTube comments in your niche.\n\nComments are unfiltered objections.\n\nFind videos in your niche with a high comment-to-view ratio. That ratio signals a content gap, people watched, but their problem wasn't fully solved.\n\nScrape the comments. List every objection, confusion, and unanswered question. Then create content that fills those gaps directly.\n\nSome of my best-performing videos came from exactly this approach.\n\n# Step 2: Turn pain into tutorials\n\nOnce the pain is clear, creating the content becomes almost automatic.\n\nThe rule: create content for one specific person with one specific problem.\n\nBecause the pain comes from real conversations , not brainstorming,  you already know the exact words they use, the exact step where they get stuck, and the exact outcome they want.\n\nThis changes everything about how you create:\n\n* One problem per video. Don't bundle multiple topics. Solve one thing completely.\n* Use their language, not yours. If customers say \"full wrap mockup,\" that's your title, not \"comprehensive mockup automation tutorial.\"\n* Mass appeal is not the goal. A video that solves a real problem for one customer will solve it for hundreds of others searching for the same thing.\n\nThe content practically writes itself when the source material is real customer pain.\n\n# Step 3: Turn tutorials into search assets\n\nThis is where most founders leave money on the table.\n\nThey upload and hope the algorithm picks it up. That's a losing strategy for low view, high intent content.\n\nInstead, treat every video as a long term search asset. Optimize for Google, not YouTube's recommendation engine.\n\nHere's why: if you want to rank on Google with a blog post, you need backlinks, domain authority, and months of effort. With video, the bar is dramatically lower.\n\nA well structured tutorial targeting a specific search query can rank on page one of Google with zero backlinks. Searches like \"mug mockup full wrap\" or \"wall art mockup\" surface YouTube videos directly in Google results.\n\nThe SEO itself is simple:\n\n* Put the keyword in the title\n* Put it in the description\n* Address it clearly in the first 30 seconds of the video\n* Add structured chapters so both Google and AI tools can parse the content\n\nThat's it. Nothing fancy.\n\nEvery video becomes a permanent acquisition asset that works while you sleep.\n\n&gt;Pain \u2192 tutorial \u2192 search asset \u2192 new customer \u2192 new pain \u2192 repeat. That's the flywheel.\n\n# \"I don't have time for content\"\n\nThis is the most common pushback. And it's based on a false assumption, that content creation is a separate workload.\n\nIt isn't. Not with this system.\n\nThe support recording you made for one customer? That becomes a public tutorial with 20 minutes of editing.\n\nThe question someone asked in a Facebook group? That becomes a video title.\n\nThe comment thread under a competitor's video? That becomes your content plan for the month.\n\nYou're not adding work. You're recycling work you're already doing into assets that compound.  \n  \n\n\n# Why this matters even more in 2026\n\nThere's a shift happening right now that makes this system significantly more valuable than it was even a year ago.\n\nAccording to \n\n[Ahrefs' research on AI citations](https://ahrefs.com/blog/most-cited-domains-ai-mode/)\n\n  \n, YouTube is the second most cited domain in Google's AI Mode , with 961,938 mentions, accounting for 9.51% of all AI citations. Only Wikipedia ranks higher.\n\n[](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HBDKzi3aYAEVTbQ.jpg)\n\nAnd this isn't just a Google thing. YouTube is also the sixth most-cited domain by ChatGPT.\n\n OpenAI trained GPT-4 on over a million hours of YouTube transcriptions. YouTube content is baked into both the input and output of every major AI assistant.\n\nWhat this means is simple: when someone asks an AI tool a question, the answer increasingly comes from YouTube. But not from all YouTube videos, from videos with clear structure, proper chapters, and well-written descriptions.\n\nIf your videos don't have that, they're invisible to AI. And that's a growing share of how your potential customers will find solutions in 2026.\n\nThis is one of the problems I'm working on solving. I'm building youTube tools specifically for founders and operators who use video as a revenue channel. \n\n# The framework, summarized\n\nFor founders who want the quick version:\n\nHarvest \u2192 Find real customer pain from communities, onboarding emails, support tickets, and YouTube comments.\n\nCreate \u2192 Make one video per problem, using the customer's own language. Solve one thing completely.\n\nOptimize \u2192 Treat every video as a search asset. Keyword in title, description, and first 30 seconds. Add chapters. Optimize for Google, not YouTube's algorithm.\n\nCompound \u2192 New customers bring new pain. New pain creates new content. The flywheel accelerates.\n\nStop chasing views. Start solving problems on camera.\n\nThe founders who figure this out early won't need to buy ads for a very long time.\n\nIf this framework clicked for you, share it with a founder who's been told they need to \"go viral\" to grow. They don't.\n\nEdit - I didn\u2019t expect this to resonate this much.\n\nA lot of people are asking whether this only works for certain types of businesses.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t work for every business.\n\nHere's where I have seen it work/or should work\n\n-Shopify apps\n-WooCommerce plugins\n-Webflow tools\n-Zapier-style automation tools\n-AI tools that require prompts or workflows\n-Design plugins (Figma / Photoshop / Canva)\n-Technical B2B SaaS\n\nExample: TinyHost an Indie Product, already does $1M ARR using the same strategy.\n\nP.S.
