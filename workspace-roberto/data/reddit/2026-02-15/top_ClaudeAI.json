I went through all of them, installed several, and figured I'd share what I found since this sub seems like the right place for it.\n\n**Where to find them**\n\nThe plugin directory lives at:\n\n    ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-plugins-official/plugins/\n    \n\nEach plugin is a folder with its own config. You can browse what's available and install from there.\n\n**The full list, categorized**\n\nI split these into two buckets: technical (for developers) and non-technical (for workflow/style/project management).\n\n**Technical plugins:**\n\n* **typescript-lsp**\u00a0\\-- Adds TypeScript language server integration. Claude gets real type checking, go-to-definition, and error diagnostics instead of guessing. If you write TypeScript this is probably the single most impactful plugin.\n* **playwright**\u00a0\\-- Browser automation and testing. Claude can launch a browser, navigate pages, take screenshots, fill forms, run end-to-end tests. Useful if you're building anything with a frontend.\n* **security-guidance**\u00a0\\-- Scans for common vulnerabilities. Catches things like hardcoded secrets, auth bypass patterns, and injection risks. Runs passively as Claude writes code.\n* **code-review**\u00a0\\-- Structured code review with quality scoring. Gives Claude a framework for reviewing PRs rather than just saying \"looks good.\"\n* **pr-review-toolkit**\u00a0\\-- Similar to code-review but focused on the PR workflow specifically. Generates review comments, suggests changes, checks for common PR issues.\n* **commit-commands**\u00a0\\-- Standardizes commit messages. If you care about conventional commits or consistent git history, this helps.\n* **code-simplifier**\u00a0\\-- Identifies overly complex code and suggests simplifications. Measures cyclomatic complexity and flags functions that are doing too much.\n* **context7**\u00a0\\-- Documentation lookup. Claude can fetch up-to-date docs for libraries instead of relying on training data. Useful when you're working with fast-moving frameworks.\n\n**Non-technical plugins:**\n\n* **claude-md-management**\u00a0\\-- Auto-maintains your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) project file. Keeps it structured, updates sections, prevents it from becoming a mess over time.\n* **explanatory-output-style**\u00a0\\-- Changes Claude's output style to be more educational. It explains the \"why\" behind decisions, not just the \"what.\" Useful if you're learning or want better documentation in conversations.\n* **learning-output-style**\u00a0\\-- Similar to explanatory but specifically geared toward teaching. Claude breaks things down more gradually and checks understanding.\n* **frontend-design**\u00a0\\-- UI/UX design patterns and guidance. Claude references established design systems and accessibility standards when building frontend components.\n* **claude-code-setup**\u00a0\\-- Project scaffolding. Helps set up new projects with proper structure, configs, and boilerplate.\n* **hookify**\u00a0\\-- React-specific. Helps convert class components to hooks and suggests hook patterns. Niche but useful if you're in React-land.\n* **feature-dev**\u00a0\\-- Feature development workflow. Structures how Claude approaches building a new feature: requirements, design, implementation, testing.\n\nThere are about 13 more that I haven't listed because they're either very niche or I haven't tested them enough to have an opinion. You can browse the full directory yourself.\n\n**Which ones I actually recommend (high impact)**\n\nAfter installing and testing several of these, here's my tier list:\n\n1. **typescript-lsp**\u00a0\\-- The difference in code quality is noticeable. Claude stops guessing at types and actually checks them.\n2. **security-guidance**\u00a0\\-- Caught a real auth bypass in my codebase that Claude had originally written and never flagged. Worth it for that alone.\n3. **context7**\u00a0\\-- No more outdated API suggestions. It actually looks up current docs.\n4. **playwright**\u00a0\\-- If you have any frontend, being able to run real browser tests through Claude is a significant upgrade.\n\n**Worth trying (depends on your workflow):**\n\n  \n5. **code-review** \\-- Good if you're a solo dev and want a second pair of eyes.  \n6. **claude-md-management** \\-- Good if your [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) keeps getting messy.  \n7. **explanatory-output-style** \\-- Good if you want to understand the code Claude writes, not just use it.  \n8. **frontend-design** \\-- Good if you're building UI and want better defaults.\n\n**The bigger picture**\n\nMy rough estimate is that Claude Code at default settings is running at maybe 60% of what it can actually do. These plugins aren't just cosmetic -- typescript-lsp gives it real type awareness, security-guidance catches vulnerabilities passively, and context7 means it's working with current documentation instead of whatever was in its training data.\n\nThe surprising thing to me was how many of these exist and how little they're discussed. I've been using Claude Code daily for months and only found these by accident.\n\nHas anyone else been using these plugins?

Either way, I've been testing it with friends the last few days as I build it and we've been able to voice chat, be in video calls, live stream games to each other, send text messages etc. You don't even need the downloadable client, you can access the web app version by just typing in the IP and port as a url, and the web UI looks reasonably well taken care of for phone screens as well. \n\n\n\nWorks well enough that I'm posting here, but by no means is this finished. There are definitely still areas where I know it has to improve, but nothing left consists of app breaking issues. I have a full time non software job and I started this project on Tuesday so I can only dedicate so many hours to getting it going. But it's in a state right now where it really is pretty stable and works. I've got a lot more planned for it and will continue publishing releases until I can't think of anything else to work into it. I am aware this is not the only Discord alternative out there, I made this more so because I wanted a lot of Discord's nitro features working and wanted the ability to build on more features as I think of them.\n\n  \nAnyway, if this is of interest to you please check it out, I'd love to see other people using something like this. For hosting a server, UPnP \\*should\\* work but at least on my network I had to port forward 8443 to get everything up and running. Minor annoyance, but it only took a minute. Let me know if you have any issues though. \n\n  \nTry it here: [https://github.com/Scdouglas1999/Paracord](https://github.com/Scdouglas1999/Paracord)", "author_fullname": "t2_pzf59", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "I built a completely self hosted, decentralized Discord alternative", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Built with Claude"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ClaudeAI", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 86, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1r4owcx", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "author_flair_background_color": null, "ups": 107, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Built with Claude", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 107, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/rsiypse5jhjg1.png?width=140&amp;height=86&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f131d20ebe9a86bbfa1f2fd5df0861bacb84700f", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "image", "content_categories": null, "is_self": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "created": 1771086422.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "i.redd.it", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First time posting anything I&amp;#39;ve made with Claude Code or similar tools, but this one might be interesting to some people.

Visual beats text, every time \u2013 you look at a diagram and instantly see \"that arrow goes to the wrong place.\"\n\nSo I have my AI agent generate **self-contained HTML files** with embedded Mermaid diagrams. One file, no dependencies, opens in any browser.\n\n**Live example:** [https://storage.googleapis.com/husky-public-assets/html-vs-markdown-plans.html](https://storage.googleapis.com/husky-public-assets/html-vs-markdown-plans.html)\n\nThis file was generated by an AI agent, uploaded to a cloud bucket, and you're viewing it right now in your browser. That's the entire workflow.\n\n**Why HTML and not just Markdown?**\n\nMarkdown with Mermaid only renders if your viewer supports it (GitHub yes, most other places no). You need a plugin, a renderer, or a specific platform. A self-contained HTML file with Mermaid loaded via CDN just works \u2013 double-click, opens in any browser, done. No setup, no plugins, no \"install this extension first.\"\n\nPlus HTML lets you do things Markdown simply can't: embedded videos, collapsible sections, interactive buttons, styled tables, status badges, tabs for different views, feedback forms. It's a full document, not just formatted text.\n\nAnd you can upload it to any cloud bucket (GCS, S3, whatever) and share a URL. Anyone with a browser can view it. Try sharing a `.md` file with Mermaid blocks with a non-technical stakeholder \u2013 good luck.\n\n**The workflow (Image 1):**\n\nTerminal \u2192 AI generates HTML with Mermaid \u2192 uploads to cloud bucket \u2192 I open the URL \u2192 review \u2192 give feedback \u2192 agent regenerates \u2192 done. You can also just open it locally or use signed URLs for temporary access.\n\n**Real example from production (Image 2):**\n\nAn actual implementation plan from my e-commerce system. Status overview with live/open badges, database schema with styled tables, flow diagram \u2013 all in one HTML file. I look at it and immediately see what's done and what's missing.\n\n**Why this beats every other approach:**\n\n* Visual verification \u2013 you see instantly if the flow is correct\n* The HTML is the shared mental model between you and the LLM\n* Model-agnostic \u2013 feed the same file to Claude, Gemini, Codex, whatever\n* No platform lock-in, no plugins, no renderer needed\n* Git-versioned, shareable via URL\n* Self-contained \u2013 works offline, works everywhere\n\n**Start simple:** Ask your agent to generate one plan as self-contained HTML with Mermaid. Open it. Tell the agent what's wrong. Iterate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gkoumcdv5ijg1.png?width=2314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc86676153ab441fabf2bd6d0346b42c51c51479\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l08ybddv5ijg1.png?width=2426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2ff2d3d9af4b9f8fbbbe8046a950960ddf34bc1", "author_fullname": "t2_26hsz5tvex", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "Be the architect, let Claude Code work \u2013 how I improved planning 10x with self-contained HTML", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Productivity"}], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ClaudeAI", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": 102, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "media_metadata": {"gkoumcdv5ijg1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 79, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gkoumcdv5ijg1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=126697e524688325078f2294910eb1558707ae5a"}, {"y": 158, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gkoumcdv5ijg1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bff06c6b42ab3a66b5c613128ef68c7e08ce6080"}, {"y": 235, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gkoumcdv5ijg1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bce1215123d1024d74f442e962832b9cb4f04747"}, {"y": 470, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gkoumcdv5ijg1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3db75b143ade2f43c3bd8e9b7366f197c8b74f1"}, {"y": 705, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gkoumcdv5ijg1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=569e8af292193c3bf25e2c3f7f4c1f9a53e5a4cb"}, {"y": 793, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gkoumcdv5ijg1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3e11b1a6c19adb716cf5d0dda299e7a853b24f6"}], "s": {"y": 1700, "x": 2314, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/gkoumcdv5ijg1.png?width=2314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc86676153ab441fabf2bd6d0346b42c51c51479"}, "id": "gkoumcdv5ijg1"}, "l08ybddv5ijg1": {"status": "valid", "e": "Image", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"y": 92, "x": 108, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l08ybddv5ijg1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c901bca3b6f56cc126beb4aae63980f0555cb8d5"}, {"y": 185, "x": 216, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l08ybddv5ijg1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89ec1a6574a57c3d508c2777f5249c9f6223b308"}, {"y": 274, "x": 320, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l08ybddv5ijg1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d28a7e5add41e0aeaba637e07bd4066d637372ee"}, {"y": 548, "x": 640, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l08ybddv5ijg1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3329f9e76212eba042a12d435ae7accc317ede24"}, {"y": 822, "x": 960, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l08ybddv5ijg1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2aa186279b32673306c69b1770061cf47f3d7bca"}, {"y": 925, "x": 1080, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l08ybddv5ijg1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0d987ac7b261c582d7afc6db6adcf7ed07ec55b"}], "s": {"y": 2078, "x": 2426, "u": "https://preview.redd.it/l08ybddv5ijg1.png?width=2426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2ff2d3d9af4b9f8fbbbe8046a950960ddf34bc1"}, "id": "l08ybddv5ijg1"}}, "name": "t3_1r4rx7k", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "light", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 57, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": 140, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "Productivity", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 57, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "https://preview.redd.it/gkoumcdv5ijg1.png?width=140&amp;height=102&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecc0062203edbbb28df0398e011b98db9e2a0bdf", "edited": 1771141078.0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1771093463.0, "link_flair_type": "richtext", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.ClaudeAI", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading plans in pure text is shit.
