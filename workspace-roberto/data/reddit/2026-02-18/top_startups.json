on quietly for the past few months.\nWe\u2019re building ZeroCarbon (zerocarbon.org.in), a tool aimed at helping startups and MSMEs deal with carbon compliance without drowning in spreadsheets or consultants.\nThis space is brutally competitive and honestly\u2026 intimidating.\nSo instead of waiting for \u201cperfect traction\u201d, we decided to put it out early and learn.\nToday, we listed ZeroCarbon on Peerlist to get feedback from builders and founders who actually try products and tell you what\u2019s broken.\nA few honest notes:\nThis is not a growth-hacked launch\nEarly numbers are small\nWe\u2019re still improving docs, performance, and workflows\nBut it\u2019s live, usable, and already teaching us things we wouldn\u2019t learn in isolation.\nIf you\u2019re curious about:\nclimate tech\ninfra products\nor just like exploring early-stage tools\nI\u2019d genuinely appreciate feedback (and an upvote if you think it\u2019s useful).\nHappy to answer questions about the build, the domain, or what didn\u2019t work.\nThanks for reading \ud83d\ude4f&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null,
