Went through plenty of failed marketing strategies after listening to random posts on Reddit to figure out what actually drives growth versus what just makes you \"feel\" busy (warning, there are a lot of b.s. strats out there)\n\nWhat actually finally worked:\n\nDiscord and Slack communities (SUPER UNDERRATED). Joined 8-10 founder communities and became known for sharing validation insights. This is a super underrated method in my opinion that many sleep on. The heated conversations in the threads on the channels revealed exactly what entrepreneurs struggle with most. When someone posted about needing startup ideas, I'd DM directly offering to help (that's the best part of these communities). Much more personal than public posts and converted way better.\n\nTwitter build-in-public content (posted about my progress). Shared actual user problems I found, demos of new features, and lessons learned. Nothing fancy, just authentic updates about the journey. Built a following of 0 - 9.8k people who actually care about SaaS. Several customers found me through viral tweets about failed startup ideas. This one takes a bit of consistency for a few months to get movement but for long term this is a GREAT WAY to show off your projects and get free traction. If you're in a position where you're posting but getting very little views, keep going. I was at less than 100 views for 10 months straight until I finally started slowly getting more views.\n\nCold email campaigns. Sent around 200 emails daily to founders who'd posted about struggling with idea validation, found thru apollo. Instead of selling, I'd share 2-3 specific problems I found in their industry with evidence from real reviews (instant value provided). About 15% would respond asking to learn more. This approach booked 40+ calls that turned into 12 customers. The only hard part about this and why many skip over this is because you have to land in the inbox. I personally use Resend, it's really good for sending emails and landing in the inbox .\n\nWhat completely failed:\n\nCold DMs across all platforms were terrible. Tried LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, even TikTok messages. People hate unsolicited DMs and response rates were under 2%. Felt spammy and damaged my brand more than helped.\n\nContent marketing and SEO efforts went nowhere. Spent 3 months writing blog posts about validation techniques and startup advice. Got decent traffic but zero conversions. Turns out people don't google \"how to find startup problems\" they discuss it in communities where they already trust the members like Reddit or Twitter.\n\nAffiliate program was a complete disaster. Launched with 30% commission thinking other entrepreneurs would promote it. Got 50+ affiliate signups but generated less than 20 total clicks, actually not even. I think one person got one click and i'm pretty sure it was themselves. People get excited about earning commissions but never actually promote anything. Pure waste of development time and I wasted about $200 setting it up using Rewardful.\n\nBuilding features before validating demand. Wasted 4 weeks developing an AI feature because it seemed cool. Launched it and literally nobody used it, lmao. Now I validate every feature idea by asking 10 customers if they'd pay extra for it before writing any code.\n\nAds. no need to say anything more. target audience (for me) wasn't on facebook. google ads slightly worked but didn't add conversions.\n\nCurrent approach:\n\nDoubling down on what works. Still spending most time in communities helping people, now with more credibility from actual results. Expanding cold email to new founder segments since the process is proven. Zero time on new experiments until mastering current channels.\n\nThe biggest lesson: people buy solutions to painful problems, not cool features. Focus on finding real PAIN first that a specific niche has, everything else becomes easier.\n\nMost people think its impossible in this community. I'm telling you it's possible, you are just not promoting and marketing enough.\n\nMY BIGGEST TIP: Find the MOST CONSISTENT complaint you see in your industry through Reddit posts or Discord Threads that have low upvotes and high comments, they have the most controversial topics and usually have a lot of pain points users face.
