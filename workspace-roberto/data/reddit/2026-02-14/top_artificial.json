You can still use Gems, but they reset every session. This means no memory continuity, which defeats the entire purpose of having a personalized assistant. You also lose native Google Drive connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a writer and content creator, this isn&amp;#39;t just about privacy preferences, it&amp;#39;s about protecting my future work. I can&amp;#39;t feed my creative process into a system that might be training tomorrow&amp;#39;s competition or having humans review my drafts and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My experience so far:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT Plus&lt;/strong&gt;: Reliable and easy, but the writing often feels generic and clich\u00e9-heavy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claude Pro&lt;/strong&gt;: Best writer, wonderfully concise, but burns through tokens fast, in less than a day&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perplexity Pro&lt;/strong&gt;: Same token limitations (want Claude Sonnet? Better hope you haven&amp;#39;t hit your quota)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gemini Pro&lt;/strong&gt;: The combination of Gems + NotebookLM looked perfect, until the privacy policy became a dealbreaker&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The frustrating part is the lack of regulation forcing companies to offer real privacy without crippling core features or having to pay more. For solo creators building a body of work, this matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How are others balancing privacy, features, and token economics? Has anyone found a setup that actually works without compromise?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "8244fc74-82c9-11e3-9460-12313d224170", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhfb", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffe3c7", "id": "1r3qsd4", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "redgoldfilm", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 11, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/artificial/comments/1r3qsd4/the_ai_tool_dilemma_privacy_vs_features_for_solo/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1r3qsd4/the_ai_tool_dilemma_privacy_vs_features_for_solo/", "subreddit_subscribers": 1221169, "created_utc": 1770993376.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}}], "before": null}}
