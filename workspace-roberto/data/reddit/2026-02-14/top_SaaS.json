You can't win against those beasts by offering the same thing; you must be super innovative and serve underserved markets.\n\nBut even if you do, you will see a lot of churn, because once users stop posting, they cancel their subscriptions.\n\nEven today, Postiz has 17% churn (which is enormous for SaaS tools), so this month it will lose $3,400 in paid subscriptions.\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022288440763772928)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022200012407787520)\n\n# Starting in open-source\n\nPostiz started (and still) an open-source social media scheduling tool (26k stars), which means that all Postiz code is out (all of it)!\n\nBuilding everything in open-source been my mantra forever, especially in the world of AI, when everybody can copy your product, what does code even mean?\n\nThat made code less important, so to be transparent and reliable, I open-sourced everything and brought many developers into the app.\n\nDevelopers never paid me in cash, but they did contribute code, test the app, write about it in many places, and bring me to $3k in MRR.\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022289290533986304)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022202113372327936)\n\n# Stuck (until I discovered...)\n\nFor a few months, I was just stuck. I had the same MRR, but my customers changed frequently. There is a formula that you can use to calculate your [Max MRR](https://longform.asmartbear.com/max-mrr/)\n\nAccording to the amount of subscriptions you bring in every month and your churn, you can understand where you can be. And I was at a dead end.\n\nSo I started serving underserved audiences and added tons of channels to Postiz. While most schedulers have 11 channels, Postiz has 30.\n\nI started to serve:\n\n* Web3 users\n* Reddit users\n* Education users (Skool / Whop)\n* Chat users (Discord / Slack / Telegram / Whop / Twitch)\n\nThat opened up my market for a higher acquisition and offered a solution that doesn't exist anywhere else.\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022204000805040128)\n\nAnd so, I got to $7k MRR (grinding my ass off) but got stuck again.  \nUntil I saw an interesting YouTube video - \"How to create viral reels on TikTok using Postiz and N8N\", the video was not selling Postiz as a tool, but selling Postiz as a part of an automated funnel.\n\nPeople take these n8n templates that do a lot of stuff:\n\n* Generate a video with veo3\n* Generate a cover picture\n* Put sound in\n* Post it using Postiz\n\nPostiz was just the last step to help you post to social media. And the workflow was automated, which means we don't need users to schedule their own posts, and that means much, much lower churn.\n\nSo it opened it up to automation people, and then OpenClaw opened it upto everybody.\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022205767198420995)\n\n# Always run hypes - ALWAYS\n\nFor me hypes a sort of big marketing push to get a surge of trials and subscriptions - they can be long-term, they can be short-term, but they give you big jumps.\n\n* N8N had an incredible 2025, and I rode that hype like crazy.\n* MCP was also super incredible in 2025, so I ran fast, made a chat agent for Postiz and MCP that you can connect to your LLM, and launched it on Product Hunt.\n* [TrustMRR](https://x.com/@TrustMRR)  was booming like crazy, I listed Postiz there, got tons of traffic, and also got contacted by  [starter\\_story](https://x.com/@starter_story)   [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPM4ImzcIFc) .\n* [openclaw](https://x.com/@openclaw)  still going on - it's the biggest one. At the moment they announced it, I went to Clawhub and published a skill.\n* [moltbook](https://x.com/@moltbook)  \\- I created a social media channel in Postiz for it \ud83d\ude02\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022289671976529920)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022207786478972929)\n\n# Playbook (marketing) \ud83d\udcb0\n\nNow that you understand my direction, I will describe my entire marketing funnel. Feel free to copy!\n\n1. Open-source - This is how I build every product. I make my [README.md](https://readme.md/) super compelling, add issues, make kick-ass docs, and start publishing it on Reddit r/selfhosted and Lemmy /c/selfhosted. At the start, it brought me around 250k views; over time, it dropped to 25k, and the channel saw me again and again. Total self-promotion is very rare on Reddit, except for open-source projects. [Example #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1l68fi2/postiz_v1470_open_source_social_media_scheduling/), [Example #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1mhhs94/postiz_v225_opensource_social_media_scheduling/).\n\n2. Product Hunt - Every number of months, I publish Postiz on Product Hunt, and every time I send a request to [ProductHunt](https://x.com/@ProductHunt) to publish before 8 months, luckily, they usually approve me \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb  \n  \nI won every launch almost. The trick here is outreach.  \nIf you have no audience, the chances of you winning on Product Hunt are low, because even when people see your posts, they don't upvote.  \nAlso, Product Hunt doesn't count votes of new users to reduce cheaters, so to win, I understood that outreach is key - might seem gray sometimes, but that's the only option. So every launch I message people on.\n\n* Active Slack Groups with founders\n* LinkedIn connections\n* X connections\n* Telegram Product Hunt groups\n\nIt's harder to say \"no\" to you when you message people directly.\n\n3. SEO - Postiz currently has 70 DA, mostly thanks to open-source.  \nThis is a channel that takes a lot of time; it's not enough to create blog posts, you actually need to get valuable backlinks and be mentioned in many places.\n\n* Open Source Directories - There are some strong directories in GitHub you can list your project on, like: \" [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) \", \" [awesome-oss-alternatives](https://github.com/RunaCapital/awesome-oss-alternatives) \" There are so many more; look for 'awesome' on GitHub.  \n* SaaS Directories - Like most founders, I started listing my application in every possible directory. It usually boosts your domain DA (it costs money, prepare for it) and lists it on platforms like  [UneedLists](https://x.com/@UneedLists) ,  [tinylaunch](https://x.com/@tinylaunch) ,  [theresanaiforit](https://x.com/@theresanaiforit)  (They also give you traffic.)  \n* Paid Directories (recurring) - This brings a lot of traffic, like  [ossalternative](https://x.com/@ossalternative) ,  [selfh.st](https://selfh.st/) . While it doesn't bring purchases, it brings a lot of traffic to the open-source and, of course, increases my DR.  \n* Using  [outrank\\_so](https://x.com/@outrank_so)  \\- It writes me one blog post a day and brings tons of backlinks to my articles. This is super useful; it's a little AI Sloppy, but it works.  \n* Outreach - I am working with multiple people who outreach to other founders about my SaaS and ask for ABC exchanges. It means I (website A) send a link to website B, and website C sends a link to website A. You can't just switch with people A &lt;-&gt; B; Google will mark you as spam.  \n* Free tools (pSeo) - if you have seen  [pbteja1998](https://x.com/@pbteja1998)   [starter story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adl5_lJfkEE)  He created many free tools on the website to drive traffic to himself. I did something similar, created a tool like \"font generator\" and duplicated it to all my socials like \"Instagram font generator\", \"Facebook font generator\", etc. This brings the most traffic per month, but not the most conversions.  \n\n3. Outreach - the previous company I sold was a LinkedIn outreach tool. I have seen people using it so spammy all the time, just sending you a connection request offering their services \ud83e\udd22 I hated it, and I don't think it works. What I did was a little bit different.\n\nI understood that people are using n8n automation with Postiz, and luckily, they were easy to target. If you go to [Skool.com](https://skool.com/) You can see tons of N8N groups. So I went to Upwork and paid someone to lead-gen the groups (I know you can write your own scraping code or use OpenClaw today), but I didn't have it back then, and it's so cheap and fast.\n\nI asked the person from UpWork to get me a list of the group owners (name, group name, email). I bought a new domain \"getpostiz .com\" and warmed it with Lemwarm, then I started an outreach campaign with Lemlist. The reason that I bought a new domain is that I didn't want it to be marked as spam (in case somebody does it)\n\nI started to send people this email:\n\n[https://share.cleanshot.com/4RmRSmNh](https://share.cleanshot.com/4RmRSmNh)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022220443953115137)\n\nThe goal was not only to \"ask\" but also to give. I gave tons of free lifetime deals for Postiz.\n\nI saw tons of new YouTube videos about Postiz, and many new n8n templates with Postiz.\n\nAnd that month, I doubled my revenue from $6k MRR to $12k MRR.\n\n\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022220789702086656)\n\n# Joined every possible community\n\nI joined so many communities that cost money, so I can socially interact with people, and here and there push Postiz, notable ones are:\n\n* Smallbets - by  [dvassallo](https://x.com/@dvassallo)  \n* Starter Story by  [thepatwalls](https://x.com/@thepatwalls)  \n* Growth Mentor by  [FotiPanagio](https://x.com/@FotiPanagio)\n* AI Thinkers by  [thekitze](https://x.com/@thekitze)  \n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022225357655748608)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n* Start today - You might be excited about all the things AI can do, and the possibility of what you can build, but actually, everybody thinks that, and everybody is building. SaaS becomes easy to build but hard to sell. I believe that if I built Postiz around 2020, I would be 1m+ ARR. Don't wait, it will become harder.\n* Build a good product - In the end, your product must be flawless (no bugs), more bugs = more churn. UX build/break a SaaS. Each feature you ship can cause more bugs. So before you ship any feature, make sure you fix your product.\n* Don't price it low - Even today, some people say that Postiz is more expensive than Buffer. I don't compete on the price; I compete on value. The lower your price is, the less you can spend on paid marketing channels and stay cash flow positive. Let's take an example. Imagine that it costs you $20 to acquire one person. Still, your pricing starts at $9, it will take 3 months to return your money, in that time you will be cashflow negative, that's hard - you would have to shut down your acquisition channel and focus only on organic channels eventually. Not to talk about spikes in your server costs.\n* Measure, Measure, Measure - If you don't know what's going on with your SaaS (can't measure it), it will be harder for you to grow. I used a website analytics tool called [PlausibleHQ](https://x.com/@PlausibleHQ). I love it, super slick. But very quickly, I realized it's hard to really understand where your purchases come from, so I switched to [marclou](https://x.com/@marclou) and [DataFast\\_](https://x.com/@DataFast_) because I want to know which blog pages / free tools brought me X amount of money so I can double down on them.  \n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022221743080058882)\n\n* If something doesn't work (like churn), stop doing the same thing. You might improve by 1%-5 %, but the better option is to pivot.\n* Always think short term and long term: Long term - brand, SEO. Short term - Hypes, launches, social media.\n* Be transparent - reveal all your metrics: total subs, money, churn - it's good for marketing, but let's face it, most chances you are not building a deep tech company. More of an AI-driven API orchestrator? Thousands more people are building something like that. Being transparent can put you above the others.\n* Growth takes time. You can build a \"hypey\" product and get tons of traffic fast (maybe also fast churn), but real growth and a brand take time. If you kept your marketing and did something for a year+, you will see an exponential growth in your SaaS, because of \"brand\" and word-of-mouth.\n* Find \"high reward channels\" - I see people who are super eager to \"build in public\" on X. It's nice, but you can find channels that will bring you a lot more views, like Reddit and TikTok. Just because some people are nailing it doesn't mean you have to.\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022224464705196032)\n\n\n\n# What's next for me?\n\nI want to take my churn to the next level - \"0%\". I launched a new service called \"Postiz as a service.\" You can basically use Postiz inside your SaaS without exposing it. Since this is an infrastructure tool, it can have almost no churn. It's part of another SaaS.\n\nThank you for reading it :)\n\n[](https://x.com/wickedguro/status/2022361200932315279)", "author_fullname": "t2_odrcvglz", "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "How I reached 20k MRR with my Social Media Scheduler (Full Playbook)", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SaaS", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_1r3vr6w", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "author_flair_background_color": null, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 60, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "is_original_content": false, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "B2B SaaS", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 60, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1771004561.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.SaaS", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think any market is as saturated as the social media scheduler market.

The trick here is outreach.&lt;br/&gt;\nIf you have no audience, the chances of you winning on Product Hunt are low, because even when people see your posts, they don&amp;#39;t upvote.&lt;br/&gt;\nAlso, Product Hunt doesn&amp;#39;t count votes of new users to reduce cheaters, so to win, I understood that outreach is key - might seem gray sometimes, but that&amp;#39;s the only option. So every launch I message people on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Active Slack Groups with founders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn connections&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;X connections&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Telegram Product Hunt groups&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s harder to say &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to you when you message people directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SEO - Postiz currently has 70 DA, mostly thanks to open-source.&lt;br/&gt;\nThis is a channel that takes a lot of time; it&amp;#39;s not enough to create blog posts, you actually need to get valuable backlinks and be mentioned in many places.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Open Source Directories - There are some strong directories in GitHub you can list your project on, like: &amp;quot; &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted\"&gt;awesome-selfhosted&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;, &amp;quot; &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/RunaCapital/awesome-oss-alternatives\"&gt;awesome-oss-alternatives&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot; There are so many more; look for &amp;#39;awesome&amp;#39; on GitHub.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SaaS Directories - Like most founders, I started listing my application in every possible directory. It usually boosts your domain DA (it costs money, prepare for it) and lists it on platforms like  &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@UneedLists\"&gt;UneedLists&lt;/a&gt; ,  &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@tinylaunch\"&gt;tinylaunch&lt;/a&gt; ,  &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@theresanaiforit\"&gt;theresanaiforit&lt;/a&gt;  (They also give you traffic.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Paid Directories (recurring) - This brings a lot of traffic, like  &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@ossalternative\"&gt;ossalternative&lt;/a&gt; ,  &lt;a href=\"https://selfh.st/\"&gt;selfh.st&lt;/a&gt; . While it doesn&amp;#39;t bring purchases, it brings a lot of traffic to the open-source and, of course, increases my DR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using  &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@outrank_so\"&gt;outrank_so&lt;/a&gt;  - It writes me one blog post a day and brings tons of backlinks to my articles. This is super useful; it&amp;#39;s a little AI Sloppy, but it works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Outreach - I am working with multiple people who outreach to other founders about my SaaS and ask for ABC exchanges. It means I (website A) send a link to website B, and website C sends a link to website A. You can&amp;#39;t just switch with people A &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; B; Google will mark you as spam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Free tools (pSeo) - if you have seen  &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@pbteja1998\"&gt;pbteja1998&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Adl5_lJfkEE\"&gt;starter story&lt;/a&gt;  He created many free tools on the website to drive traffic to himself. I did something similar, created a tool like &amp;quot;font generator&amp;quot; and duplicated it to all my socials like &amp;quot;Instagram font generator&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Facebook font generator&amp;quot;, etc. This brings the most traffic per month, but not the most conversions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Outreach - the previous company I sold was a LinkedIn outreach tool. I have seen people using it so spammy all the time, just sending you a connection request offering their services \ud83e\udd22 I hated it, and I don&amp;#39;t think it works. What I did was a little bit different.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understood that people are using n8n automation with Postiz, and luckily, they were easy to target. If you go to &lt;a href=\"https://skool.com/\"&gt;Skool.com&lt;/a&gt; You can see tons of N8N groups. So I went to Upwork and paid someone to lead-gen the groups (I know you can write your own scraping code or use OpenClaw today), but I didn&amp;#39;t have it back then, and it&amp;#39;s so cheap and fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked the person from UpWork to get me a list of the group owners (name, group name, email). I bought a new domain &amp;quot;getpostiz .com&amp;quot; and warmed it with Lemwarm, then I started an outreach campaign with Lemlist. The reason that I bought a new domain is that I didn&amp;#39;t want it to be marked as spam (in case somebody does it)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started to send people this email:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://share.cleanshot.com/4RmRSmNh\"&gt;https://share.cleanshot.com/4RmRSmNh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022220443953115137\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The goal was not only to &amp;quot;ask&amp;quot; but also to give. I gave tons of free lifetime deals for Postiz.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw tons of new YouTube videos about Postiz, and many new n8n templates with Postiz.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that month, I doubled my revenue from $6k MRR to $12k MRR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022220789702086656\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Joined every possible community&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I joined so many communities that cost money, so I can socially interact with people, and here and there push Postiz, notable ones are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Smallbets - by  &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@dvassallo\"&gt;dvassallo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Starter Story by  &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@thepatwalls\"&gt;thepatwalls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Growth Mentor by  &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@FotiPanagio\"&gt;FotiPanagio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AI Thinkers by  &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@thekitze\"&gt;thekitze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022225357655748608\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Start today - You might be excited about all the things AI can do, and the possibility of what you can build, but actually, everybody thinks that, and everybody is building. SaaS becomes easy to build but hard to sell. I believe that if I built Postiz around 2020, I would be 1m+ ARR. Don&amp;#39;t wait, it will become harder.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build a good product - In the end, your product must be flawless (no bugs), more bugs = more churn. UX build/break a SaaS. Each feature you ship can cause more bugs. So before you ship any feature, make sure you fix your product.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t price it low - Even today, some people say that Postiz is more expensive than Buffer. I don&amp;#39;t compete on the price; I compete on value. The lower your price is, the less you can spend on paid marketing channels and stay cash flow positive. Let&amp;#39;s take an example. Imagine that it costs you $20 to acquire one person. Still, your pricing starts at $9, it will take 3 months to return your money, in that time you will be cashflow negative, that&amp;#39;s hard - you would have to shut down your acquisition channel and focus only on organic channels eventually. Not to talk about spikes in your server costs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Measure, Measure, Measure - If you don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on with your SaaS (can&amp;#39;t measure it), it will be harder for you to grow. I used a website analytics tool called &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@PlausibleHQ\"&gt;PlausibleHQ&lt;/a&gt;. I love it, super slick. But very quickly, I realized it&amp;#39;s hard to really understand where your purchases come from, so I switched to &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@marclou\"&gt;marclou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://x.com/@DataFast_\"&gt;DataFast_&lt;/a&gt; because I want to know which blog pages / free tools brought me X amount of money so I can double down on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022221743080058882\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If something doesn&amp;#39;t work (like churn), stop doing the same thing. You might improve by 1%-5 %, but the better option is to pivot.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Always think short term and long term: Long term - brand, SEO. Short term - Hypes, launches, social media.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be transparent - reveal all your metrics: total subs, money, churn - it&amp;#39;s good for marketing, but let&amp;#39;s face it, most chances you are not building a deep tech company. More of an AI-driven API orchestrator? Thousands more people are building something like that. Being transparent can put you above the others.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Growth takes time. You can build a &amp;quot;hypey&amp;quot; product and get tons of traffic fast (maybe also fast churn), but real growth and a brand take time. If you kept your marketing and did something for a year+, you will see an exponential growth in your SaaS, because of &amp;quot;brand&amp;quot; and word-of-mouth.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Find &amp;quot;high reward channels&amp;quot; - I see people who are super eager to &amp;quot;build in public&amp;quot; on X. It&amp;#39;s nice, but you can find channels that will bring you a lot more views, like Reddit and TikTok. Just because some people are nailing it doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have to.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/wickedguro/article/2022361200932315279/media/2022224464705196032\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What&amp;#39;s next for me?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to take my churn to the next level - &amp;quot;0%&amp;quot;. I launched a new service called &amp;quot;Postiz as a service.&amp;quot; You can basically use Postiz inside your SaaS without exposing it. Since this is an infrastructure tool, it can have almost no churn. It&amp;#39;s part of another SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading it :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://x.com/wickedguro/status/2022361200932315279\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "0d828010-b6fa-11eb-aea6-0eea1032fba1", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qkq6", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "id": "1r3vr6w", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "sleepysiding22", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 34, "send_replies": true, "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/SaaS/comments/1r3vr6w/how_i_reached_20k_mrr_with_my_social_media/", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1r3vr6w/how_i_reached_20k_mrr_with_my_social_media/", "subreddit_subscribers": 564873, "created_utc": 1771004561.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "SaaS", "selftext": "Been building automations for clients and my own projects.
